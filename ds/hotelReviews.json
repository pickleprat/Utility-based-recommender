Kuddos to the entire team of Rani Mahal!!", "This was my first solo trip and I believe I couldn't have made a better choice than staying at Rani Mahal. It stood up to all expectations I had - the staff and manager were very helpful, kind, polite, and diligent. I had to attend the RIFF dawn concert at 5 am and they made sure I had a conveyance to the venue.  The owner too was very receptive to suggestions. The decor was very unique, and the room was not only aesthetic but very huge, so was the adjoining bathroom. Their rooftop view is fantastic, with the panoramic view of the Mehrangarh Fort on one side and the blue city on the other. I would definitely choose to stay with them again, if I go visit Jodhpur in the future.  ", "We stayed in the roof top room which had a beautiful view of Jodhpur's old city and fort. The service and staff were excellent - they helped us get our clothes washed quickly and provided food to our room. The food was delicious.  There were 2 negatives, which the hotel staff helped mitigate: - the wi fi in the room was unreliable, so the staff kindly offered to switch our rooms to one with better wifi. The wifi is reliable everywhere else in the building. - there was a lot of noise at night from music on the rooftop, traffic, and barking dogs. The hotel staff got us earplugs when we asked, which helped.", "+We did like the personal response and attention from some of the staff due to the fact that nothing in the \"hotel\" worked and we constantly needed their help or assistance. -Electricity was coming and going. No hot showers and te shower itself was not working properly, just a sad stream of cold water. Internet was sketchy at best. Room was cold with no opportunity to make it warmer as the A/c was only for the warm months. You get 800 INR to 1200 INR room value in a place that charges 6000 INR.

Highly recommended.", "Very beautifully crafted place, very friendly staff and amazing food. Mr. Dinesh was very humble, very helpful gave his personal contact in case of any challenges and anything needed. Gave us a good view of where to go and what to visit in Jodhpur.

The food from the roof top restaurant was excellent and the view over the city and fort was amazing.

We booked two executive cottages for 2 nights as we were left with not much choices.  But, yes, our choice was just right! The resort is located in a very calm and serene location in the outskirts of the town. The property is comparatively new and very clean and green with lots of lovely colourful flowers blooming all over the place, a swimming pool surrounded by long bushy hedge (for your privacy I suppose), a lawn covered with thick green grass onlooking your cottages and rooms.   Rooms are well furnished with basic amenities, prompt room service,", " restaurant with quality food, but with limited menu (you do not get all the items listed in their menu).

It has plenty of greenery with a very nicely decorated restaurant and breakfast room. The room is adequately furnished though a bigger cot than queen size would be better. The food tastes good including the complimentary breakfast though priced a little on the higher side. The best part was the quiet surroundings even though it is really near the tourist attractions.", "We had been to this resort to celebrate our 8th Marriage Anniversary on 14th Feb'21. We checked in on 13th Feb in a standard room and later from 14 to 18 it was upgraded to an Executive Cottage. Although the initial glitch of room selection was at our end but I profusely thank the resort authorities to be kind enough to upgrade.  To start with we were sanitised and greeted with heartiest welcome and promptly showed us to our room aftr prompt completion of formalities. The room (standard) is quite spacious for a couple, fully furnished with enough supplies of toiletries & tea/coffee/sugar etc. The room has a great view of the entire resort n also has a little cozy personal balcony where one can sit n relax. Room service is very prompt just at da dial of 09. So is the restaurant", " service. The food is too good to mention in words. I'm out of words to describe the \"good tasty food\". No sarcasm.  The pool is also very well maintained with pristine clear water. The staffs r very cooperative, amicable n helpful.  They have a personal boutique \"Mohor Saaj\" which has reasonably priced apparels. What I disliked : 1) No separate parking space for residential guests.  2) Allowing restaurant guests/ outside guests at the pool side while there was rush. On 16th there was Saraswati Puja and the restaurant is well acclaimed for the food they serve. So it's obvious there will be rush. So when there is a rush the extra guests are being allowed at the pool side ( they also can be allowed in the open air space/meadow which is photogenic from every corner). As I wear swimming costume n I was in the pool at the very time I felt very much discomfort for being stalked and stared by the outside guests. It lacked the privacy. Also the guests r smart enough to vacate a chair which was previously occupied by us wid towel, cam and room keys all by themselves without taking our permission. This thing which happened with me is highly non appreciable.  I suggest to accomodate such guests in the meadow adjoinging the restaurant n strictly prohibit them from entering the swimming pool area if ders any guest spcly lady in da pool. Apart from this, the resort is photogenic at every corner. Daily room cleaning, laundry service , good food , nice ambience, nice staffs...

It has some unique collection. We ll definitely come here once again.", "The resort built at a serene location and the facilities at the resort was of top level. Spacious Rooms, Clean Washrooms, Perfectly Sanitized - what else could one asked for after this covid situation? The foods were tasty, prepared maintaining proper hygiene. The staffs were very much courteous and they were always a phone call away. The spread of complimentary breakfast was quite good on all the three days as well as a la carte options were also quite good. The nice playground for the children and the swimming pool were the cherry on the top for a family vacation. The winter weather with such a beautiful quite place would certainly make anyone at peace.

All the fans in their room were not working.   Restaurant food is decent, and it is a commercial place. The people who walk in the restaurant are allowed near the pool also.

There are a few issues with this property- 1. There is an access road issue as it’s located bang opposite to Pune Railway station,  access  road and exits are narrow and you have to be careful as high speed cars pass by during entry/exit of the property. 2. Rooms which I had been given has brownish water from the taps. The housekeeping staff has to run the tap open for an hour to get clear water. Then the issue was fixed. 3. Room had a strange dusty/ damp odour of  carpet  4. Terrace swimming pool is very dirty. There is pigeon poop all over the place. Changing rooms does not have proper lighting and toilets were soiled.

Out of two rooms that we took, one was really good and the other did not even have a washroom door that could be locked. Which is a definite problem when you're sharing the room with a colleague.

The bed linen was super clean, the pillows comfy, and the bathroom huge and clean. We had our own large private balcony overlooking the pool. (This was suite number 208).

The aesthetics here are lovely, with a park with swings in a lawn below, and original wrought iron furniture placed all around the pool. We liked the food too, as it was tasty, simple and not overly spicy (we took the all inclusive deal, with all 3 meals). All in all, a royal experience!

{"place": "Chokhi Dhani Resort", "reviews": ["For celebrating my birthday with family, I booked this resort for 1 night stay via Agoda. While booking, I filled all the details like how many adults & children (with their age) would be staying and accordingly I paid complete tariff amount. While doing the check-in at resort, they asked me to pay around Rs 4000 for my daughter being 12 yrs. I told them that I have paid full amount based on all the required filled details, then why this hidden charges??? It took long discussions which spoiled our mood also and finally we had to pay the charges which was totally mistake of Agoda software and their technical issue which was to be sorted out between Resort and Agoda but ultimately we had to suffer. I also requested resort to pursue atleast with Agoda from their side but they told", " that in any case we have to pay the amount and they will take up with Agoda separately. I even don’t know whether resort finally took up this issue or not with Agoda as I do not see any email though I requested to keep me in loop.", "Visited for 2 nights during Holi in 2022. The theme based property is impressive in its expanse and eye for detail in recreating typical Rajasthani motifs. While it is relatively dated, it has been maintained well and still looks quite impressive. They have a village fair type of thing going on every evening which I think is the star of the show for this place. It offers magic shows, games, animal rides and a shopping experience all in one place, in a reasonably well curated and sanitized setting. It is truly fun for all age groups - of which we had adequate representation in our party of 5. Full marks for this experience.  Where I found this property lacking was on the food front. Breakfast was good, but ala carte was just ok and service was inconsistent and slow. Certainly not", " upto the 5 star billing this place assigns itself and charges for.

No regrets for selecting the property, Chokhi Dhani village was a perfect place to spend a couple of days with multiple options in the village for everyone. Village is beautifully maintained and people there are extremely courteous, if you strike a conversation you would know the effort they are making for their living specially in Covid. We spent most of our evenings in the village and had a brilliant time.  Now coming to the resort, honestly disappointed with the overall experience leaving aside the polite reception staff. Will break the feedback into different buckets: 1. Check in experience was smooth, not much of a hassle. 2.", " Food & Restaurant: While the live music scene are amazing and must for an evening for sure however morning/afternoon restaurant staff was very rude, unprofessional and clearly didn’t look happy with what they were doing leave aside following a simple trait of this industry of smiling to your guests. Clearly this was a let down for sure though in pockets you could see some people doing a good job. Overall good options and quality was really good, worth a few meals for their vast menu and ethnic food collection specially the live counters in evening.  3. Building experience - No mark down here in my rating but sure this could have influence for an extra star. I mentioned during my booking on their website, mentioned at the time or check-in also about the occasion we have come however forget about adding some basic decor or a cookie as gesture, looks like no one was reading it and wishing also. If I compare this with my experience at West Inn Sohna road it was mind blowing for sure so they shall at least start reading what customer is writing.  4. Room service was good, no complaints overall and were reasonably quick in delivering given the short staff due to Covid. Delays mostly were due to staff issues so not blowing this off understanding the situation.  5. Village - This is the high point and every minute spent there is worth it, crowd management in Covid was tough but management was doing everything possible to keep reiterating. Multiple options, good setup, music and shows makes it a perfect place to visit. ", "I booked 2 cottages. The rooms were clean, the staff were courteous. I had a bad taste of the arrangements during breakfast. The breakfast area could hardly accommodate 25% of the people stay at this place, resulting in long wait times. In my case about 35 minutes. Even after that I left the place without having the breakfast. For such pricey place like this, I’d expect a top notch arrangements. My personal experience is nothing but bad.  I would not go back to this place.", "We stayed here for a night in Feb,21 and it was an extremely disappointing experience! Firstly, only 4 rooms were booked in the entire Resort and it looked like they cleaned the Resort before Covid. It was dirty! Unwelcoming and bad attitude from staff made the stay worse. Mosquitoes were all around the Resort and first thing they offered in the Room was a ‘Mosquito repellent’. Linen quality was bad and fridge was not working(which got replaced around 9 PM) Breakfast was even more disappointing with very limited options and stale muffins and cakes.  Overall a big No to whosoever is planning to visit this resort!", "We called up the resort to ask whether a lunch would be possible as opposed to the famous evening dining experience. To which they replied yes as they have ala carte from 12-3PM. Which was perfect as we were a group of people who'd have different appetites and pallettes and could order little/lot depending on the situation. We drove 3 hours to get to the resort only to be shut off literally at the parking lot stating you have to shell out a ₹1500 cover charge per person. This wasn't stated on the phone call and when we requested to the lady at door to call the manager, she was just informed to let us off if we weren't keen on paying the cover charge.

Our stay came with nothing but disappointment of having spent a bomb on this poorly maintained and utterly sub standard property. The most astonishing was the behaviour of the staff who made us wait for more than an hour at the time of check out; even check in took 45 minutes even though I repeatedly kept telling that I have a business call with my clients (I ended up taking it from the reception area).

No alternate arrangements for open air dining space in case of rain.  2. no COVID protocols were followed (no mask, no sanitiser no social distancing)  3. In case of rain there was no arrangement of umberallas to assist inhouse guests despite requests.

Shabby arrangement for buffet dinner was made in a indoor space and everyone was forced to eat the buffet despite the fact that property hosts a a la carte restaurant too.  5. Buffet dinner of 1600 per person, especially indoors in that clumsy space was so over priced. My family was asked to move to buffet hall from the a la carte restaurant...again in the rain.  6. Understand that nobody can control weather situations but we can certainly be prepared to handle it.  And why should only guests bear the brunt of it...if resort could not give services as per expected standards they should offer some discounts in such situations.  7. On raising this to front desk no action was taken and rather was made to wait for about 30 mins before saying a no.  8. A lady at the front desk (not naming her purposefully) passed on a cheesy comment on me which she thought might douse the situation. Had a similar comment might have been made by a male guest to a female employee of a resort it would have surely come in the bracket of indecency.

They will charge you extra for which you have not played. They also provide you Dinner coupons when you take entry from inside the Hotel but here they trick you.

I must tell you, this palace is worth all the hype around it. We stayed there for two  nights and we had the best of times. We just wanted to relax from our busy schedule, if one wants to relax this is obviously the best place to be, after a resort. The spa i must say is one of the best, the herbal tea , the spa rooms are so spacious, the therapies are really therapeutic, they make you feel so relaxed and so humbled. You feel so refreshed, so amazed and therapeutic. The food at all the restaurants are fabulous but i would personally recommend Steam, the wood fire pizza is a must and the Strawberry cheesecake is something I'd recommend", " without any doubt. The Polo bar is so peaceful one can sit there and enjoy their drink with ease and have a wonderful time I'd recommend for one to have the Jasmine sour Martini and the Udaipore Martini, absolutely one of our favourite cocktails yet. The rooms are lovely, make you feel cozy and absolutely lighted, we love natural light coming into our room and we were treated with just that, and fortunately for us we were even upgraded :). They have such wonderful activities to keep you entertained throughout the day, they've got vintage car rides and one of the cars happens to be the Plymouth, something we see here only back at the States, lovely to see that heritage right in India and what a better place to be than Rambagh, kateeb assisting us on the same.  A lot of people made efforts to make our stay memorable, but Shubham and Sanjana from the front desk made it exceptional, Karan and Khateeb from Butlers. A true gentleman.  Well we had a great few days, but for sure a place to be back with friends and family.", "The queen mother of luxury palace hotels in India couldnt get more legendary. It may well be that no other hotel is more closely associated with the pink city of Jaipur such that walls are in themselves a history lesson. When you look at 100+ year old carpets maintained and smelling as if they were bought yesterday - you will simply be amazed! This is the kind of place that makes you dream big, spoils you like no other. The sunniness outside is eclipsed by what's inside the hotel - their staff! We've stayed at some of the best in the world including Park Hyatts, Mandarin Orientals, Four Seasons, Waldorf Astorias, Relais and Château, Raffles, Oberoi vilas properties and even Taj Lake Palace Udaipur but Taj Rambagh has surpassed them all, all thanks to each and every member of the", " staff who embodies the spirit of hospitality deep within.   The tripartite design of their suites where you pass through the hand painted art walls of the veranda to the parlor, and then into the bedroom and the bathroom, the appearance reels of luxury. The birds and peacocks and peahens all around, in corridors, gardens and on rooftops - being fed by hand by the staff and guests alike, this place makes you feel like a king. We had a horse charriott ride, a ride in the 1961 S-class with a sunroof and a historical walk of rhe palace. What could be more special?  The food and drink is like no other. The chefs are outstanding whichever cuisine you choose. We ate at the Rajput Room and the Veranda Cafe and tried North Indian, Rajasthani, Mediterranean and Chinese food. Every dish was prepared to perfection, both in terms of taste and presentation. The flute playing by Nadeem Khan ji and the exceptionally caring service and mind blowing cooking skills of Chef Priya left us spellbound during breakfast. For lunch we had Yogendra ji spoil us with all the incredible choices of food he suggested. During dinner Ms Riya and Prem Nath ji brought us lip smacking dishes without stopping. Ms Riya was at her feet non stop for hours serving multiple tables without letting a drop of sweat stop her - never seen someone with so much dedication! The next time, we will also try Suwarna Mahal and Steam.  Now coming to the stars who help put together the whole stay, surprising us at every juncture, leaving no stone unturned in making my father's birthday celebration so incredibly special- Ms Harshita and Ms Swati. Ms Harshita got in touch with me 24 hours before our check-in and followed up on the minutest of details. Right from showering us with rose petals upon welcome, upgrading my parent's room to the Historical Suite, decorating it so elegantly with flowers, cards, pictures of my father and the whole family, they were simply outstanding. Believe me, they were not done with us even after checkout - surprising us with farewell gifts (a silk tie and cuff links for my dad and beautiful coasters for rest of us). Cannot thank both of them enough!  Ms Harshita even checked on us a day later to ensure we reached home safely! Who does that!! I've been simply blown away by her dedication and hospitality. She is a clear example of how to lead by example. The best part about the whole team setup was to see how rest of the staff looks upto her and work with such coordination.

We were blessed to be at Rambagh as the hotel took utmost care of our room n dinning experience considering covid situation. They knew we were very particular about social distancing n sanitisation so they moulded their system to suit our safety standards. The team made sure not many people/staff entered our room or would try to block an isolated spot for us in a restaurant . It was so personalised that they redefined hospitality standards. I have been to many 5 star properties which have an underlying commercial attitude towards guest but Rambagh n its people value the very values of ethical n transparent outlook. .

It's crazy that the amount of personalization to detail is absolutely stunning something that pleases your eyes and soul. We were actually part of a wedding, to be honest, it was our first Indian wedding that we were attending to. The flight from Canada is heck of a long flight and to catch a interconnecting flight to Jaipur late in the night, well firstly the moment we landed we had positive feel towards the place and weather in the city is lovely, so pleasant, i mean i would call this the perfect weather.

We were greeted so warmly by Raman the manager and were offered fresh refreshments and cold towels, that actually made us feel really fresh, all the tiredness going away. We were walked towards our room by probably the humblest person we've come across, Shubham, he was kind to show us in and arounds of the room, and he told us this was a residence of the king, where he actually stayed in, and i was shocked i requested if we could around with the history he said absolutely, since we requested for an early morning one, he made sure we were infact helped with the history of the palace. Would like to thank Komal and Karan for the same, it was a magical experience for us. Kateeb, also, showed us the spa area and it was such a greatttttt one. The breakfast area the Rajput hall was such a beautifully made restaurant, it's like being treated like an actual king/queen of the hotel.

The places where the functions took place, sorry can't recall the name, but was mesmerizing to be there and see the magic of Indian culture to its display.

The property is beautiful heritage property with green lush lawns. The place has a huge peacock population. Strolling in their lawns is the best thing to do at their property.   The suite was nice and spacious. All the upholstery was old. If you pat the cushion, dust came out. The rugs also smelled of old carpets.   Our first meal was breakfast and it happened to be a Sunday. There was chaos in the restaurant. We got a table after some waiting. The service was very very slow. We had to ask for a dish multiple times and also got dishes replaced as they weren't tasteful. It was a terrible experience as per Taj standards.   After giving the feedback, the team was on their", " toes. They hosted us and made up for all the poor service. We had great food and hospitality post that. It was worth all the money. Their Indian restaurant and Italian restaurant had amazing food.   Next day we were shifted to a wash and change room which must be their base category room. We were glad we didn't book their room. If you are looking to stay at Rambagh, it only makes sense to stay in their suite. Spending money on their base category room is a waste - furnishings are very old and the room feels stuffy.", "Our first stay at the Taj Rambagh did not disappoint us it lived up to the reputation. Taj is the epitome of customer service, in every aspect, right from the doorman to the managers. Every single person we encountered were service oriented in every way possible, extremely polite and accommodating. The Indian culture of welcoming people and making them feel at home, was felt throughout our stay! Even booking a room at the Taj was shocking - an upfront forced payment was not required, and rooms could be cancelled or changed up to to the day of booking at no extra cost. Other large hotel chains have a lot to learn from the Taj group. We stayed for 3 days, dined in - the food was awesome, and had a sublime massage at their Jiva spa specially Jemina the manager there, very humble", " and polite.  Excellent excellent service.

More than the food the service so personalised it's like they know me for years, especially Harish & Arihant. The team at the reception, Shubham who met us and took us to our room, even mentioned that it's the original palace and that's when we were drawn to knownthe history. We humbly requested the team for a history tour as we missed it every single day because of city outings, but Khateeb, Manish and Goutam they showed us around, the steam, the suites and my oh my what a wonderful tour it was.

It speaks of Grandeur of a bygone era, which has been lovingly restored and maintained by the Taj group. We had meals at all 3 restaurants, the Rajput Room serves excellent meals and we were well looked after. Steam offers excellent and a different ambience, though the menu can probably be expanded.  The signature Suvarna Mahal restaurant is opulent, with it’s frescoes and alabaster lamps and Italian chandeliers and gold plated service, but personally I felt that there was some miscommunication , since the Maas ke Sule, which we had ordered were extra spicy and I found it difficult to eat them, despite my mentioning upfront that I had no tolerance for spicy things. Maybe , if the chef or the server had mentioned while taking the order, that the recipe cannot be tweaked and is extra spicy, we would have changed our order. However, the Lal Maas was nice. The Spa section is another haven, where one can destress in the beautiful outdoor jacuzzi . This section is full of birds and dancing peacocks and a sight for sore eyes .The staff at the spa and pool are very nice and helpful.  Any property is as good as the people who work there, and the staff at Rambagh Palace go that extra mile to make you feel special .

Presumably booked several weeks previously. In the event I didn't travel to India.   And now, within 7 days of arrival in India, they have cancelled my booking AGAIN! This time for a film shoot, which I assume was booked several weeks ago.  I stayed at Samode Palace, once, many years ago, when I was allocated the room at the top, front of the palace, underneath the flagpole.   At the time I took many photos (prints) which I placed in an album for my elderly mother whose sight was failing ~ but she liked to see pictures of my travels and she's since passed away. I was working overseas at the time and unfortunately all her photo albums got mislaid", " during the house clearance process. I hoped to replace some of the photos during this trip ~ but sadly it's not to be.  It's all very well Samode Palace saying I can \"shift\" to Samode Haveli, but I have stayed there before as well, I've visited Jaipur many times, and to change my routing to Jaipur at this late stage would mean upheaval and major changes to my extensive itinerary. And I'm certainly not going to pour any more money into Samode Hotels.   At present, my UK and Indian agents are trying to find alternative accommodation in the Samode area, which isn't easy as the major festivals fast approach.   I was also hoping to visit Chand Baori stepwell from Samode Palace, and depending on where I end up staying, it's possible that too may have to be cancelled.  So, thanks Samode Palace, for messing up fond memories of my late mother, messing up my itinerary, plus causing extra work for my agents in the UK and India.  From previous reviews I see you have \"form\" for this type of behaviour ~ so given that I've now suffered two cancellations at your hands, maybe it's time you decide between being a wedding/film shoot venue or valuing and hosting paying guests; be they from India or overseas.  I thought there was a saying in India \"Guest is God.\"  Apparently not as far as Samode Hotels are concerned, and considering the cost of (attempting) to stay here, I would suggest others think very carefully about making a reservation ~ or else have a \"Plan B\" prepared given their propensity for last minute cancellations.", "The property is a portal into the past.

The suite also had a private balcony with views of the nearby mountains. Samode Palace arranged a free tour of the Durbar Hall and other areas which were closed off.

My accommodation was in a block just opposite the main pub/ restaurant. It was roomy, nicely decorated and with a snug but well equipped en-suite with shower. It's a little bit outside the centre of Melbourne ( about 10-15 minutes walk). I walked up into town but couldn't decide on anything to eat so went back to the Hardinge for dinner.

The couple who run it were very pleasant and the breakfast next morning was very good.

But the guy waited around for a tip which we wasn't really prepared for as was so early.  To start off with the pools. The pools and the slides are amazing! people do get up early  to put the towels down (as they do everywhere) ,but we manged to find some as the resort is so big we tended to mix it up one day pool one day  beach one day adult pool.. Adult pool you have to be 16+ or the life guard will tell you  to get out. They serve alcohol at this pool but not all. The beach the beach is a sun trap extra su  cream is needed .

To start off the food al a cart you can only book once per stay not unlimited  as jet2 etc  states. Its only one restaurant  per stay so 2 weeks 2 trips 1 week 1 trip. We actually  complained  at this, there is 4 restaurant  Turkish, Italian, fish, and Asian. You can pay to go to these extra to your free one which is €10 pp. This is definitely  worth it. We went to all restaurant  but the fish and all was beautiful  definitely  recommend..  If your  a wine drinker bring your own  plastic wine glass or you end up with a plastic mug of wine..

We didn't pay a great deal of money for this holiday but we had a fantastic time and the hotel location is stunning. The grounds around the hotel are well maintained, and facilities are very good, especially the slides, beach bar, beer garden bar, and snack bars. Plenty of sun loungers and never once did we have any issues obtaining one. The guys on the skates are constantly bringing drinks to you, but the bars were never too busy even though I was told the hotel was at full capacity.

The gym is", " well equipped, with plenty of tennis courts, volleyball and football pitches along with archery and table tennis.   My only concern was the main restaurant, it was chaotic at times and the transition of people from inside to out was manic. This was the only area that let the hotel down in my opinion. The food was OK, we are not fussy eaters but we did find it difficult at times to put combinations together. We found the snack bars to offer better quality food and the 'gozieme' woman was a lovely touch at dinner time. The Al-a-carte restaurant was superb, and we did the Turkish and Asian and these are a must-visit. My tip would be to sit upstairs in the main restaurant where it's less busy and the waiters up there are more helpful.  The beach location is great, with plenty of water sports, camel rides, and drinks available at the beach. The entertainment was limited but the Mongolian circus was fabulous. We mainly stayed in the lobby bar and found this to be on the small side when the weather cooled in the late evening. The girls in the lobby bar worked tirelessly as did most of the staff I encountered. Probably just needed a few more staff in certain areas such as the main restaurant and the food areas inside and outside of the main restaurant.

Bekek was only €5 euro in a taxi and the wonderful land of legends only €15 away, both very worth a trip and taxis easily arranged at reception within 5 nins.

The room also smelt very damp when we first arrived. We did complain and request to move rooms due to the awful view/noise and damp smell but this was rejected by the rude unapproachable reception staff. The reception staff are so rude and have little to no customer service skills, particularly the lead receptionist who proceeded to call us liars over an A la Carte booking.

Food boring, cheap unappetising, some mixed up concoction mixed up from the night before left overs. Would have loved some sausage or bacon but failing that some regular beans would have been nice, mashed potatoes, roasted veg or at least something that looked like it hadn't been through the blender. Nice coffee, juices very sweet for the kids i watered them down. Alcohol very basic which is normal.  The resort had some free activities but also a lot of extra paid stuff that I didn't feel were value for money. Toys that broke instantly, toy cars, ball machines, trampolines all have to be paid for. Any activities all paid and they were the top end of western prices. 5€ for 5 minutes on the trampoline. Big resort which made it a little harder to get to know your fellow travellers together with all the languages meant everyone stayed in their own pods.  Spa massage starting at 100e to 120e rediculous for a massage. If the spar reduced its prices for small treatments instead of trying to get you to book big packages more people would use, browse and try a few things.  Entertainment so so nothing great, ice cream hut very very basic, over priced pictures, trinkets.

We chose the hotel for its accessibility and location since my mother is in a wheelchair and most of our family is in North Bangalore. From the moment we arrived, everyone was very friendly and helpful. Our driver Frances who picked us up at the airport drove very well and ensured that our luggage was looked after. He even helped my cousin find the detour for the airport since there was construction in the area.

In particular, Pooja and Radhakrishnan, made sure that we had everything we needed and that all our Covid", " testing documents were printed when we checked out. Pooja checked in on us from time to time to make sure that we didn’t have any issues. As breakfast was included in our package, we were able to enjoy the food from Lush every morning.

Chef Prasad did a wonderful job making sure that there were a variety of options including mysore masala dosa and pesarrattu. The service by the maitre’ds like were especially notable. They always made sure that we had a table with space for my mother’s wheelchair and that our coffe and tea came out piping hot.

Overall, I would recommend the Renaissance and look forward to staying there in the future.", "This was really a wonderful hotel. Big spacious room, great bathroom, fantastic atmosphere. The breakfast was very good. But there were several things that spoiled a good impression. First of all in our double room was everything prepared for one: one glass, one hand towel, one pair of slippers and one bathrobe. There was a problem with communication in the dining room. I asked for 2 omlettes with cheese and onion. I got one with tomatoes and don’t know what else. I have repeated my request for 2 omlettes, but only got one. The main problem was the card keys that didn’t work in the lifts. People were struggling to get to their floors, going up and down and this a very bad experience! Please fix it ASAP.", "This was one of the most memorable stays my wife & I have had in all our life.

The houseboat is wonderfully carved and comfortably furnished with 3 large bedrooms, all ensuite. The food was delicious and freshly made, and the cook consulted with us each day as to what we would like the next evening.  On occasion we decided fairly last minute that we would have lunch on the boat, and he catered for that as well.  Nothing was too much trouble and Riaz really went the extra mile to make us welcome and to look after all of us.  We appreciated the added touch that shikara rides to the nearby landing stage on the opposite side of the lake were included in the price of the houseboat, and that one of the staff would call for one whenever needed. ", " The area of Nigeen Lake where Riaz’s three houseboats are moored is peaceful and serene with stunning views of the mountains  -  yet within easy reach of Srinagar centre.  There is abundant bird life and we saw a kingfisher really near to our boat three times within the first hour of us arriving, and numerous times after that.  Thank you, Riaz and staff for a very relaxing and happy holiday!", "If someone wishes to experience true Kashmiri hospitality, Houseboat Inshallah (HBI) is the place to visit.  The houseboat is situated at a quaint location with no commotion, guest can enjoy the beauty in peace and solitude. The way the property is maintained is exceptional. Mr.Riaz ensures the guest are catered to the maximum, he is gem of a person and I do cherish the long chats we had in front of the bukhari with hot piping cup of kehwa. The boats are intrinsically designed with Kashmiri wood art, which would amuse you and at the same time you can't help admiring the hardwork that goes in making and running the property.  The food that Mr.Riaz supplies from his kitchen is simple yet healthy, something very close to what we have at our homes daily, proportion is enough to fill", " the tummies. Visitors throng towards Dal for enjoying their houseboat experience but end up being disappointed because of the noise and commotion, to beat this it is highly recommended to stay at Nagin and if at Nagin then what place else than HBI.

If you are in search of peace, tranquility  to sink in to the beauty of a hoseboat stay in kashmir , highly recommend to book at nigeen lake.  Book the houseboat having the snow capped mountain view. To reach this houseboat   you need a 15 min shikaara ride  (arranged for free) . This is situated on the other end of nigeen lake.  A common living area and dining room greets you once you enter the verandah area of houseboat. Kashmiri decor gives the authentic feel of a houeboat stay.

I didn't want anything in the commercial area of Dal lake but preferred to stay in the serene area of Nigeen Lake. My call to Owais Wangnoo of Inshallah houseboats put all my fears to rest from day one. Owais was prompt , honest , responsible and comforting. Any query or questions I had were answered patiently. When I entered the houseboat I was lucky to have it all to myself. They have shikaras on hand and the tide from ghat no 1 to the houseboat is free.  My houseboat had a completely antique and rich feel. This has been in his family for generations.Complete with wall to wall  rich carpeting , beautiful picture memorabilia hanging on the walls the houseboat unit consisted of 2", " bedrooms both with bath tubs , a massive antique four poster double bed and a smaller single bed at the side. My favourite place however was the balcony outside where I was happily perched watching the stillness of Nigeen lake for hours and drinking endless cups of tea sometimes reading a book. What I loved about this place was the homely hospitality. Every day Owais made it a point to ask me what I wanted for dinner and breakfast and served me that and more. Breakfast started with bed tea followed by eggs of your choice and another item on the menu. Dinner was a 4 course meal and if I said I wanted a particular dish it was either made by the cook or brought from one of the famous restaurants nearby. My favourite was the kulfi. If you visit ask for it. Every evening Owais father dropped in for a visit . At first a bit formal we then became friends and discussed everything from Bollywood to world politics and his Dad even gave me company for dinner so o didn't eat alone. The houseboat also has a back side connected to the road so you don't have to wait for the shikara to go out. For a shikara ride please ask for Abid arranged by Owais himself. Since the place is so quaint and silent no sellers disturb you and you are just left by yourself in peace. People often asked me how I stayed alone in the houseboat and wondered after my safety. But I felt the most safest and looked after here. I stayed for 8 nights in between trips to various places and happily returned each time to my second home. Even when I was traveling elsewhere Owais made sure to call and check on me. The evenings I was free I hopped onto his scooty for local market shopping. All in all I will definitely go back because for me Inshallah houseboats is my second home. Oh and did I mention that  the person who works almost 24 hours smilingly , answers your queries and manages several houseboats is only 23 - Owais you definitely have far to go.", "It is a beautiful houseboat floating on the Nigeen Lake, flaunting exquisite walnut furniture and carved deodar wood-work. The hospitality catered by Bilal ji is unparalleled.

I suffer from asthma and was doubtful whether the rooms would be ventilated enough, but the rooms are not only spacious but have large windows for ventilation.

ShoutOut to Ajay for making our stay wonderful.", "We stayed here for two nights in March 2020...just a few days before India went into their first lockdown. As a result many of the facilities (swimming pool, sauna, etc) were closed as per Goverment instructions. The usual cheeriness of the Taj staff seemed to be replaced by a coldness, there where very few guests at the hotel and we felt a little like we where an imposition on them, not overly welcomed, just potential Covid carriers. We booked one of the more premium suites at the top of the hotel. The room itself was lovely, but it was disappointing to see how grubby and unkempt the area just outside of the room are.

Floor tiles in the room appear worn out and fancy curtains need replacement. Huge lawns have grey grasses and water bodies are dry. Breakfast spread has cheese only for decoration and bakery items are of quality one finds on Shimla mall road.  None of the above one expects from a Taj property.

We were both given flower necklaces. Our check in was in our room which was a nice touch.  Our room was very large and well decorated.  It was the size of a suite but a single room.

The door lock is unusual too as it is a very large brass padlock with one very large key.  Quite a novelty and you are urged not to leave it on the wooden furniture.

I visited here with my daughter on the recent trip. Our room was very large and had a bathroom and adjoining change room these were fit for a queen.

The manager picked up and organised everything.

She scrubbed my feet and then went straight to my face with the same oil without", " washing her hands. I had to ask her to stop. It was GROSS and even after scrubbing my skin clean in the room I came out in pimples two days later (very rare for my face).

The locality is peaceful and the area is great. The only drawback is that the room rent is on the higher side. They should reduce the price as the people visiting the hospital need the room for longer duration and the budget gets drained over time. The monthly tarrif is costly too for just one room. All in all a good place for short stay.", "Lives up to its name   I stayed here on a solo trip during Diwali time and have only good things to say.

She was incredibly friendly, attentive and provided the great amount of conversation and efficiency to get me to my room. As a Marriott Platinum member, she was great at recognizing my loyalty, and despite already being upgraded to a Suite, she went ahead and provided a one-category upgrade to an apartment instead which is always a valuable and treasured experience.  During my global travels, she is probably, one of, if not the best associate I have worked with to welcome me into the hotel.  Prathamesh the Butler. It appears that St Regis Mumbai does not have an eButler service, but despite that, he gave me his number and was able to always reach him", " whenever it was required.  Chef Preeti, I may have gotten the name wrong, but she was the chef handling the Vegetarian only breakfast in the secondary dining room. Not just the chef, but the entire breakfast team was on top of all the requests and serving all guests with graciousness and utmost respect. Preeti even walked around introducing herself to me and letting her know if there is anything she can do to make a more comfortable breakfast experience. That is always appreciated.  The breakfast team also arranged a special goodbye cake as well, I'm not sure if it was because I was Platinum or something else, but those small gestures really translate a great stay to a memorable stay.  If you are a vegetarian traveler, the fact that they offer a separate breakfast, away from the non-veg option is the first time I've seen it during my travels, and this experience was great. I never had any doubts over my food and there was absolutely no risk of cross-contamination, a very important thing for me.  Overall, this stay was incredibly amazing.  My only small gripe with this hotel is that the bellman at the lobby, they leaev the baggage unsecured on multiple occasions across multiple stays.", "It was my first time visiting Mumbai and I was so impressed by the care and hospitality I received from the hotel’s staff. Namrata Bhalla, Ahad and their team went above and beyond in providing care from the moment I stepped through the door. They facilitated restaurant reservations, steamed and pressed clothing items, and provided numerous recommendations for activities, shopping and sites to see across the city. Namrata even brought out a special dessert for me on my last day of the hotel, which was very kind and thoughtful gesture. The hotel itself is clean, quiet and very comfortable - it is very much up to date, and offers several bars, restaurants, and complimentary activities. I particularly enjoyed the spa and the rooftop pool, where I received an amazing 120 minute", " scrub and massage and enjoyed sunbathing with an incredible view. The hotel is well located in the middle of Mumbai, equal distance from the northern Bandra area and the southern city center. Security is top notch - every vehicle is checked by security before entering the premises and every patron must pass through metal detectors before entering the building. The hotel is adjacent to a mall, which offers numerous high end / brand name designer stores. I fully recommend the St. Regis to anyone visiting Mumbai for work or leisure - you won’t be disappointed.", "I'm quite privileged in that I am able to travel frequently and experience a lot of what the world has to offer. And being a Marriott Bonvoy member I have the even greater privilege of staying at some of the most amazing hotels around the globe.   Following a very memorable stay at the St. Regis in Osaka, Japan, I was incredibly excited to book a stay at the Mumbai St. Regis. Needless to say, what originally began as a one night reservation was quickly extended to four nights.   The one thing that amazed me the most is the service intrinsic to the Mumbai St. Regis, and I can confidently say this level of amenity has not been matched anywhere worldwide. The service began before I even landed in Mumbai, when was greeted with a kind message from Manisha, my go to agent for anything", " I needed during my stay. This pre-arrival gesture alone set a brilliant standard for what was going to be an amazing journey.   As soon as I landed, my dinner reservation was pre-organised, and Manisha warmly showed me my room explaining all the hotel amenities throughly. As the days went on she was very important in ensuring everything taken care of with regard to tourism recommendations, dinner reservations and even very niche requests such as options for fitness and personal training.   I would also like to mention the amazing concierge Sohan, who was not only cordial, but knowledgable, clear and decisive. Similarly, the housekeeping staff were incredibly diligent and kind, to a level which I cannot thank enough.   Overall, my stay at the Mumbai St. Regis has set a supreme standard for my worldwide expectation of any 5 star service, and this was definitely accentuated by both Manisha and Sohan's amazing and professional service. I cannot recommend them enough and their ethic is integral to the Marriott and St. Regis brands.   I have told everyone I know about this amazing experience. I hope Marriott continues to maintain this supreme destination in Mumbai, and uses it an example for all other St. Regis's locations around the world.", "Recently stayed at the hotel for a 4 night stay whilst visiting family, had a very mixed experience of the hotel as a single female traveller.

Checked in at 10pm had to wait over 45 minutes for my bags to be delivered and had to call 3 times to request bags to be delivered, I was very tired and just wanted to sleep as soon as possible.   2. Both Saturday and Sunday morning housekeeping were outside the room chatting and talking loudly at 7.30 am. Not a relaxing start to the day  3.

Not only was there the sound of the room being serviced but doors were being opened and shut and there was loud talking amongst the staff. This is completely unacceptable.  4.

We chose St.Regis as also to experience the Lower Parel area which has been growing rapidly over the past few years.   The Regis was central to all that we had planned for our quick 2 days.    We wish we could have experienced the property more thoroughly as the pool,  restaurants and bars were enticing and beautifully decorated.   Reason for the 2nd trip 😉!   The breakfast at the St. Regis compares to no other in Asia during our trip so far (India,  Thailand, Laos, Vietnam).  Not only was every Indian and Intl speciality available but each one tasted delicious! The fresh sugarcane juice and three types of idli were on my plate even when lunch was scheduled for later 🤦🏽‍♀️.  ", " Our experience was topped with a wonderful Butler - Khushi Jain.  She was on point for every need we had and even scheduled a celebration for my son when she found out he had just graduated(see the pic!) !  She organized a perfect takeaway breakfast for our early morning train to Surat.  Our stay was worry free as we could communicate with her at anytime over whatsapp and she was extremely responsive.    One piece of feedback for the St. Regis - we were surprised by the lack of an upgrade for a Bonvoy Titanium member of a few years who was paying for the room?   Hopefully for the 2nd trip 😉.", "In summary, it was the typical excellent service one expects of a St. Regis. From the moment we stepped out of the St. Regis car that picked us up at the airport and were whisked away for a private in-room check in by our butler, Khushi, to the warm send-off days later, we felt welcomed and pampered.  This was my wife's first time to India and we were visiting my old haunts from childhood.  Everyone made us feel at home.  Khushi was very attentive, but not overbearing and intrusive. She was connected with us on What's App with immediate responses. More than ensuring our well-appointed room was clean, she surprised us with little gestures throughout the stay.    The restaurants are probably some of the best in Mumbai and very reasonably priced. The breakfast spread has something", " for everyone and had Masala Dosa and Sambar that reminded me of my childhood. All the restaurants were beautifully appointed and the creative food presentations (art really) were as fun to look at as they were to eat. I feel compelled to mention Chef Taj who was particularly attentive during our dinner at The Sahib Room and Kipling Bar.  He came out to meet us, chat about the dinner preparation, and made sure that we were well taken care of.  The service is incredible from general manager to valet. Sanket, one of the valets is from Bandra, a section of Mumbai in which I lived as a child. He spent significant time giving us points of interest and how to manage taxis and lunch etc. He also ensured that my wife's car and luggage were ready for the airport (she left a few hours after I did).  A beautiful hotel, wonderful service, warm and welcoming people, and amazing memories.  We will be back!", "As a solo black woman traveling to Mumbai, I found the service to be quite welcoming. The check in experience was seamless and all of the amenities of the property were explained to me in detail. The main drawback of my experience was how crowded the hotel was and how that impacted how quickly I could board the elevator to get to and from different areas of the hotel. The butler and housekeeping staff were amazing and I was delighted to find little tokens of their appreciation each day after I arrived from various excursions. The highlight of my trip would have to be my experience with Namrata, the restaurant manager of seven kitchens, each day she ensured I had the highest level of service at the breakfast buffet and encouraged me to try different Indian meals to expand my", " palate.

We are Ambassador Bonvoy members and were kindly given an upgrade to an One bedroom apartment overlooking the race course on the 30 th floor overlooking the race course and the sea. The room was state of the art in its luxurious decor and beautiful bath with all modern amenities.

Little did I know that I was in for a rude shock from this world renown hotel! We checked in on the 27th of December for a period of 7 nights. Upon entering the room, we thought to ourselves that it was fantastic. To our disbelief, the excitement ended in 2 minutes. The hotel room was dirty and it seemed as though it had been unused for a significantly long period of time. When we called the reception they told us that they would send someone took take a look, but for 30 minutes no one called or came up. It was after I got furious and demanded that I wanted to speak to the GM that they sent someone from housekeeping to check the room. The lady told us that the room we were in was not even", " sellable and she didn't know why we were given that room. After that the team offered to change our room and showed us 3 different rooms all of which had dirty cutlery, rusted kettles and dilapidated fittings. After consistently arguing with the team and asking them to allow me to speak with the GM or a higher authority they sent someone from the services team who profusely apologised, got a room absolutely deep cleaned (though didn't bother cleaning the AC vent - of which I have attached a photo). This just shows the level of preparedness that this international property has for its quarantine facility. Both of us have dust allergies and I even got a mild asthma attack the next day due to the dirt and dust in the room.  While the service from then on was great, unfortunately the first day had already set the tone for our stay.   We strongly recommend avoiding this hotel for quarantine as the allocated rooms are dilapidated and unused for the longest time.   The only plus here is the size of the room and the politeness of the staff.   Thoroughly disappointing!!", "It's a good hotel. Rooms are well appointed and comfortable. The check-in area feels very cramped, especially when they are busy. It's a good location, huge mall next door with plenty of food and shopping options.   Service tends to be hit or miss, especially in the breakfast restaurant.  Either you get a lot of attention or no one looks at you, depends on the day and your luck. Getting a cappuccino could potentially be became an ordeal. The breakfast selection is decent,  similar to other hotels in the category.  The Peruvian/Japanese restaurant can be skipped. The food is mediocre at best, especially if you are used to good Japanese food from elsewhere in the world. A lot of the menu items were unavailable. For example, they make a big deal about their Blood Mary and have 4", " different types listed but only one is served. Limited Sake choices, of which some are not available. Edamame looked like it had been sitting around for a couple of weeks, dull and dry. Gochujang ribs were missing gochujang all together. The noise level was very high. The ambiance and clientele felt like the place was for people who wanted to see and be seen, not really there for the food.  The Champagne sabering event and Violet Hour are over-hyped, not much to it. So unless you have time to kill sitting in the lobby,  you can skip it without missing anything. The champagne is cheap and sweet. The violet martini is decent.  "], "rating": "4.5"},

Also cooking making and mock tail making which they went out of their way to organize since we had missed their official timing.  I missed Shravan Singh Ji at the gym.

They use to have somebody for morning yoga and this was also not available during our stay.   We also missed the local artist playing the Santoor for breakfast.

The spa pool was also not operational and we believe they should inform us this at the time of booking or put it up on the website. It’s the monsoon season and Jodhpur is also very hot at times so the spa pool was a welcome relief during our previous stays.

I had also informed the housekeeping that it is my wife’s birthday, so they apologized and offered us a bubble bath set up. The next day went well but the day we check – in wasn’t that pleasant, little disappointed, as this was my second visit to the palace. Had planned a holiday with lot of expectations, as our first experience was really great.

Overall a must-visit and experience Palace !!", "We went for a stay for 2 days 13-15 October . At the start itself , the hotel upgraded me for being a loyal customer of the chain . Alka and her team guided us through the check in , which was seamless. The property itself is magnificent; however no experience is memorable unless the hospitality is above excellence and the tone was set from the first . The suite given to me was superb with one sit out giving the view of the Mehrangarh Fort and the other Jaswant Thoda . For some one like me who loves such views, this was much appreciated. Then comes the hospitality of the staff . As I was on a full board meal , I had all the meals in the property . Chef Shobhit Mathur , coming to know of our penchant for local cuisine , suggested items which were off the menu and specially", " curated for us . Junglee Maas , Rajasthani thali to name a few . He also suggested us the palace specialties over breakfast and other meals . The food was delectable and one could feel the essence of every ingredients used . The staff in the restaurant were equally on their toes and amidst outstanding hospitality suggested other portions to have .  N Singh , Narendra Singh , Jabbar Singh , Raval Singh , Saddique forms a superb team and each out do the other in their hospitality and of course Shobhit himself .  The spa is extreme relaxing and special mention to masseuse Reena for providing a very relaxing massage . The best part was that when she came to know that my body was stressed , she provided extra attention to relieve without bothering about the time .  House keeping was equally good except there was one glitch ; when one of them mistakenly cleared my cigar . It was however promptly replaced by the duty manager Manveer, and this gesture is much appreciated.   Overall it has been a seamless and full filling experience to the minute details in as much as even the door man escorted us to the museum and got us a guide for a walk through. Clearly an example of over and above duty .  I have been a customer of Taj group for last 25 years and it has never failed my expectations.. rather every time spoils me to look out for more in my next visit .   I hope this feedback reaches the right authorities jn the group for them to know that their people leave up to their ethos and more and the group is privileged to have them .   I am already planning my next trip with the group.

The western deserts are though lagging in this field. The service staff like Karan, Jabar, Hem and others made our stay very comfortable.  Housekeeping staff were very efficient and steadfast and are like the unsung heroes, who operate behind the shadows.", "We spent 2 nights at Umaid Bhavan in early November and it was truly a Royal Stay.   Right from check in, where they upgraded one of our rooms from a Heritage Suite to the Royal Suite, and Diya gave a teddy bear to our 2 year old toddler, to check out, where they presented us with a couple of small gifts, everything about the stay was fantastic.   Both the Heritage Suite and the Royal Suite where large and impressive. The bathrooms were the size of some hotel rooms! The rooms were immaculately clean and Anamika and Ravi from housekeeping were always available for anything we needed. The courtyard outside the room was a great area for morning strolls and for our daughter to collect flowers. The palace itself is very impressive. The interiors and exteriors are nothing short of", " breathtaking. But what really sets this apart from other hotels, is the staff all around. Right from the lifeguard at the pool, to the driver we had taking us out, everyone is always going out of their way for you.   The food is another highlight. Breakfast is all ala carte which means everything is fresh when it comes to you. The traditional thali is delicious, albeit too much for one person to eat. The italian and chinese food was also very good. I would like to specially thank Chef Shobit and Chef Vikram for organising food for my toddler. I would also like to mention Saddique and Chandan who served us passionately at the restaurants. ", "The best stay of mine till date.

Only drawback is the staff don’t always recognise when you’re happy to do so alone and might try to engage at all opportunities. I liked the location as there’s  a village right outside with friendly locals which is also nice to walk around. The food portions are very generous and have a good variety of both veg and non-veg.

Hospitality and food was top class. The decor and the very cozy feel of the fort was really touching.

Towels are good and smell lovely, a first for us in India. Rooms are big. Each lodge has its own plunge pool.

A local walk looking at wildlife is offered in the afternoons. We were offered a trip into the village and I understand there is a trip for safari which we didn’t know about. Sometimes information is a little sketchy. But all in all I thoroughly recommend this place.

The hotel is set around a small lake with just 12 guest cottages. The cottages are beautiful in their traditional, almost rustic way, and they all feel like they are completely on their own. Each is incredibly spacious inside with high ceilings and multiple rooms, as well as an outside area complete with a plunge pool. The setting of the hotel is stunning and you feel like you're completely immersed in the scrubland wilderness. There were many areas to relax, like atop or within the building overlooking the pool, or indeed anywhere in the grounds.   The food was amazing, with the chefs producing some of the best curries I've ever had. What's more, there is no ordering. The", " food is simply laid on for you, and all of it, from the canapés and starters to the desert, is phenomenal. Most of the food is cooked using produce from their own farm, and it is unbelievably fresh and delicious.   One other thing of note was just how fantastic the staff were. They were always around to be of assistance and were incredibly attentive at meal times. Moreover, if you desire, they will put on activities for you such as a nature walk around the grounds, mountain biking, bird watching, kayaking, star gazing, a traditional pottery demonstration, spice mixing etc.  It is probably my favourite hotel that I have ever stayed in, and if I ever return to Rajasthan I will be certain to revisit it.", "The Brij at Lakshman Sagar is an oasis of peace and tranquility. An old hunting lodge has been transformed into an eco nature resort with a handful of rustic 'cottages for guests set around a huge lake.

It was pretty cold at night (about 3°C) while we were there but we were given a room heater and hot-water bottles for our bed (oh joy!). The staff are knowledgeable, attentive and friendly – Rocky, Dayal and Sartok deserve special mention. I'd also strongly recommend the massages given by Amul.", "A beautiful property managed by people who need basic training in hospitality.  Pros- property, room size, staff (other than the manager) and food (when you do get it on time) Cons- Manager lacks basic etiquette and service can be very slow.  Here is our experience from our last week’s trip especially with one of their manager named Indrani.  1. Four of us sat around the bonfire and sang some songs not loud at all and not too late either it was about 7.15pm. We were point blank told by Indrani not to sing and sit quietly as it ‘might’ disturb other guests (there were a total of just 2 other guests at the property at the time other than the 4 of us). All this based on a ‘might’ nobody had complained since we weren’t loud to begin with. While I understand and it’s important not to", " disturb others but we weren’t loud, we were not playing music on our phone and it was just 7.15pm. With no other activities to do around this property I am not sure what else one can do around Christmas Eve! I went on a vacation to this place not to sit quietly around the fire that I can do at home too.  2. Next day when we all were soaking the sun in their common area where they had spread soft beds to do exactly that, we were told to move to our own rooms since they were expecting other guests to check in and in their mind us sitting together on 4 beds was getting in their way of aesthetics. Seriously! Then why have you spread those beds there? You should put a board there that reads ‘for show and aesthetics only’. Am I not a guest too who paid for the stay? How and who decides when can a guest use a service and when is it not okay? This was down right ridiculous to be told to move to your room, nobody gets to decide where we can and should or should not sit!  3. The food was quite good but the service was so slow that when you got the bread the curry was delayed or when you got the veggies the breads took so long that we almost always had a cold meal. Quite a downer since the food did taste good. This should and can be fixed easily but I am not sure why nobody pays attention to these more important aspects of the stay.    In all if you don’t mind being told off and given feedback on what to do, what not to do, at what decibel to talk and when not to, sit in one place or the other and eat cold food then do visit the property is actually pretty just all the rest of it is very unprofessional and down right bad experience! I will never visit this place again and I won’t be recommending it to my friends and family either.  ", "The place absolutely beautiful, peaceful and calm. I stayed there for new years with my girlfriend. They had so many interesting activities, such as bird watching, safari, trekking. The food was made mostly from vegetables grown in their garden or the local village. Which I felt was very thoughtful. They were very connected to the nearby villages and empowered them w job opportunities by making us undergo experiences of their markets and dining with them, which led for income to the people residing in those villages. We even saw LEOPARDS twice on our trip. Best part is no animals are harmed, and are freely allowed to roam around. The service was amazing and the general manager, Dilip was very involved with all the guests ", "Perfect spot for a Honeymoon. Very friendly staff, special thanks to Kai. Both the nature guides are splendid, the know a lot about plants, animals, and stars.  Waking up with the sound of peacocks.   The landscape is food for the soul and also the real food is very good.   The swimmingpool is mindblowing. The cottages are very private and there is a lot of eco equipment wich they ask you to use. Soap, skincare, shampoo, thootbrush….", "From the moment we arrived into the beautiful setting of Lakshman Sagar we felt taken care of.

We had traditional Indian food which was very homely. Private pool,picturesque lake, clay construction of the resort , privacy of each cottage , amazing hosts, clear sky for star gazing , calm and serene atmosphere are some of the major features of this place.  This place isn't for you if : 1. You are looking to party with loud music etc. Property is constructed keeping in peace with the wildlife and nature, hence loud parties etc will definitely take away the calmness from", " this place and scare off the surrounding animals.  2. If you have very young kids. The terrain of the area is rocky/hilly. There is some amount of walking involved within the property as well and there are edges from places near the cottages which is not safe for young kids. They would have to be continuously monitored.   3. If you hate walking. The cottages are built around the lake and some distance is kept between these cottages to maintain privacy which is actually excellent. But if you just cant walk then this isn't for you. One needs to wear walking shoes here as its a rocky area.  4. If you cant do without people/crowd/TV/internet/etc. The property is designed for quiet getaways. So ones coming from busy city life may take a second to absorb the quietness all of a sudden but once it sinks in, the peace can definitely be appreciated.  5.

However I would avoid the jacuzzi and sauna/steam.  They are located in a small non vented area, mould is visible and the tiles were broken entering the jacuzzi.

To be honest it would have been quieter to stay in the hotel as Hoi An was crowded and noisy. The staff at the hotel are really nice and eager to please and the food in the restaurant was very good.

Staff in the beach bar, restaurants and around the pool were so friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet was excellent. On our second night we received a letter to tell us that there was going to be an event on the grass in front of our bungalow with music lasting until 10pm. To compensate this, the hotel offered an additional free bus to and from Hoi An old town for that night. We took advantage of this and whilst we were not a fan of the", " loud music when we returned at 9.30, it did stop at 10pm. The next day, we noticed the hotel staff setting up for another event in the same way. This time there was no offer of a shuttle bus. We went out of the hotel for dinner and put up with the noise again which stopped at 10pm. On this occasion, we spoke to staff at reception to say that we didn’t like the loud music. The response was-‘but it stopped at 10.’ We asked if there were going to be any more such events for the rest of our stay and were told no. Disappointingly, there were at least 4 more events throughout the week on the grass and beach in front of our accommodation. On one occasion, the team building event was set up around our sun beds and we had to move when it started. Each time, we were disturbed by microphones being tested, loud music and team building events from around 3pm and lasting until 10pm. These took place in front of our accommodation on the grass next to the beach bar and restaurant. One more offer of a shuttle bus was given. On our penultimate night, we asked about the lack of shuttle bus and the hotel did pay for a taxi to take us one way to the old town. However, the following day, another loud team building event started at 3pm on the beach and continued into the evening. The attendees were shouting, laughing and singing Karaoke. Even though we had asked about the bus the previous night, no bus was offered.

For that price overall room isn’t well maintained ,Stains on walls, chipped n stained furniture, NO wifi . Quality is worth ₹2000 -3500 room.  Food quality is poor , they will serve u with pre-filled water bottle instead of packed bottle . I think management is careless abt customers & there health .   Last but not least they will push u to checkout at 11am while in the booking mentioned Checkout time is 12noon .", "I'll begin with the things that matter to me,  there were no plastic bottles for shampoo, lotion, body wash and drinking water.

This is an amazing resort situated in the heart of NCR (Manesar).  Frankly speaking I being the organizer was a bit hesitant initially but after I personally visited the property, rooms, conference hall, food menu etc. I gained confidence. I guess it is the biggest resort in NCR with such a greenery. We witnessed couple of peacocks & ducks in morning hours.  Must say, the front desk staff ladies (Saroj and Bhawna) are very professional and makes our corporate group check-in very smooth.

{"place": "Hibiscus Garden Inn", "reviews": ["Hibiscus is, in our family’s opinion, the best place to stay in Puerto. We found this beautiful inn when we first arrived in Palawan back in 2017. As Americans adjusting to a new home in the southern region of the island, we occasionally needed a place where we could get away from our responsibilities and relax for awhile. Hibiscus was always amazing. We cannot say enough good things about the way we were treated by the hospitable staff and owners. It was always easy to book a room and they were always ready for us no matter how late we arrived. We would walk in the room and find hot water and coffee cups and all the bedding we needed. They were so thoughtful!  The rooms have all been beautifully updated. The air conditioning and fans keep the rooms cool and the hot water system", " is wonderful. These are both a big deal for foreigners like us! :-) The mattresses were comfortable, the bedding clean, and insects are really kept under control. To be fair, it is nearly impossible to keep all bugs away but Hibiscus does WAY better than most. I don’t ever remember seeing ants in the rooms - and we stayed in many of them. Every evening they lit mosquito coils outdoors and my wife and I enjoyed sitting outside just to relax spend time visiting.  The wifi service was adequate although not very fast on a mobile device. You can get better speeds if you sit on the comfortable sofa in the lobby or go to the restaurant.   The restaurant is top notch! We always got their pizza and it was amazing. Pasta and salad were also our favorites. Breakfast was so relaxing with fresh french press coffee and a variety of food combo options - Filipino, American, European, etc.  Hibiscus was our family’s retreat from the daily grind for the five years we lived there. In May, 2022 we had to say goodbye to Palawan and return to the States to begin a new career. If (hopefully “when”) we return for a visit, you can be sure we will visit our friends at Hibiscus.   Thank you everyone at Hibiscus for taking such good care of us during our many stays with you!  Andrew, Keren, and kids", "We stayed there for almost a month while we were house-hunting. Our comments follow…  Food: very good, especially the pizza. They have a restaurant and bar on the premises that also includes room service and poolside service 😍  Rooms: very good. The rooms were cozy, clean, and modern. Their personal room safes were inoperable and require upgrade. However, we still felt very safe during our stay and had no reason to be concerned with leaving our valuables within our luggage. The staff were very nice and displayed integrity.   Safety: as mentioned above, we had zero concerns or issues with being safe. During the evening hours there is an on-site security guard roaming the property.  Parking: we parked our pickup truck on premises but be advised that there is very limited parking.", "  Costs: the daily room rate was approximately 500 pesos lower than two other hotels that we have stayed at in Puerto P. The overall experience by comparison was equal to or higher than other those two hotels.  Internet & TV: If you’re looking for a hotel that has great internet and tv service then from our experience you may find it difficult. We experienced 50% - 70% of little to no service of during our stay at this hotel as well as the other two. I’m unsure if these are problematic areas for hotels in Puerto but that’s what we experienced. Good luck with your search for those two features.   Pool: Excellent. The pool was always clean and warm especially for a pool that is located outside. 😍  Overall: Yes! 👏🏾 I recommend this hotel! The owner is very kind and family oriented. His staff was kind and valued us as customers.    Notre expérience pendant notre séjour s'est déroulée sans problèmes ni conflits.  L'hôtel est magnifique et entretenu avec beaucoup de soin.", "We stayed here for 4 nights of our 3 week holiday in the Philippines. Everything was perfect from collection at the airport through to booking our onward travel to Port Barton. The rooms were spotless and the fittings in the bathrooms had a lot of thought and style. Showers were hot and rooms all have there own fridge. Beds were comfy and each room has its own hammock too.  The pool area was lovely to relax in and all beds and outside chairs are very comfortable. The food here is OUTSTANDING, as is the service! We run a small hotel in the UK and my partner is a chef and we were very impressed with the fresh pasta, pizzas and seafood on offer here. All of which was cooked to a high standard. Don’t miss the tuna carpaccio! We ate here every night and didn’t bother trying anywhere", " else in case of disappointment. Cocktails were equally delicious and creative. Brilliant service from Sweet on the bar! Reception organised a Honda bay tour for us which was a brilliant day out and ran smoothly.

Centrally located, about 3.0 km from the airport, 1.5 km from the Palawan Heritage museum and provincial Capitol, 1.1 km from Kalui's, and 600 m from Guniguni 2. Warm welcoming staff (especially ma'am Arlene) who never tired of coordinating our tours despite several cancellations of our underground river tour. 3. Clean comfortable rooms with outdoor seating and hammocks 4. Charming touches around the hotel eg. Umbrella's provided in open walkways in case it rains, and Himalayan table salt for the health conscious 5. Peaceful environment, did not even notice that they were holding a Christmas party in their restaurant.  NOTES: 1. Tours are to be paid in cash 2.

They have an amazing Tropical garden surrounded by a beautiful swimming pool.  We stayed in Puerto for 3 nights so we tried different places and Hibiscus if from far away our favorites.\t  They have a very nice menu and we recommend of course their Pizza and we really enjoyed their Lasagna and Pasta. We also enjoyed their Goat Cheese Salad and Lamb Shawarma. The Indian and Thai food option are also very good.  We can only recommend this place and next time we will for sure sleep there 😊", "I am a local here in Puerto Princesa City and is still very impressed by the overall ambience this exclusive garden has to offer. We had our wedding preparation and photo-video shoot here last May, and the management and staff could have not been more accommodating and friendlier. Almost as if they were family. Their rooms were more than spacious, their confined view is breathtaking, and a bonus of specialty food exclusive to their Garden Inn.  We highly recommend the place, if you are looking for a hideout that is accessible to the amenities of a City.  Big thumbs-up to team Hibiscus!", "We stayed for four nights with another couple, faultless service from wonderfully friendly staff. Nothing was too much trouble from from start to finish, we enjoyed the traditional feel of the buildings and gardens and felt very comfortable.  Drinks and food in the restaurant were perfect and very well priced, we would also say the transfers and trips arranged with reception were well priced and ran faultlessly. We had a problem on our last night with a faulty air conditioning unit in our room, although it was past midnight the management arranged a room change with no hesitation, excellent customer service.   A highlight of our visit to the Philippines was definitely the Hibiscus..", "We had great stay at this place. The staff is super lovely, also they are super flexible, helping us out in many cases.  Pool is perfect for relaxing after a long day.  Would like to also say kudos for the staff as they were really helpful, when arranging tours, transport or just providing us with recommendations.  Wi-Fi sometimes not perfect, but still works fine most of the time, so it is not a big deal.  In short, I highly recommend it, it's close to the airport, the food is great.  P. S.:Everyone should try the homemade pineapple rum, I don't think it receives the appreciation it deserves 😊", "Hibiscus Garden Inn is a unique hotel with beautiful, locally made furniture.

{"place": "The Westin Sohna Resort & Spa", "reviews": ["We spent 2 nights here with family (one of my kids is 13 months old) in their Premier Villa. First things first, they are taking good care during this pandemic and following all precautionary norms. This was the most important criterion for us as we had a little baby with us.  Their villas are spacious with comfortable amenities. All the menus are digital to reduce contact contamination with options for in-room dining all day long. It was my birthday over the weekend, and we got a cake from them (although my name was spelt wrong and there was no room decoration of any kind, not even towel art, as was promised to my husband). As the villas were a little old, the plumbing was a bit of an issue sometimes with rusty/leaky faucets. It wasn’t a major fault though.  We really enjoyed", " all the family friendly activities available during the pandemic times, esp the petting zoo and the paid activities like GoKarting and Shooting.  Food is satisfying and the quality is good but their spread is limited. I don’t know whether that was due to covid or this is their usual affair. Considering the property is 5 star, I was hoping for more breakfast/dinner options like cheese platter and more options for salads.Indian menu is quite adequate though.  Special mentions for Ms Jyotishka at F&B who helped us immensely with arranging food for my toddler and patiently waiting on us.  Huge shout out to the elderly man who managed the Petting Zoo area, he’s a gem of an employee. He went above and beyond his professional duties to keep the kids engaged and informed about all the animals.  Over a good experience. I would love to revisit once all the amenities are open/available post corona times. ", "Just returned from a weekend break at Westin Sohna and glad that we did it! We were little apprehensive of visiting during pandemic but somehow decided to go ahead.  Being a titanium bonvoy member, we were upgraded to a luxury villa with a pool. Ms. Oindrila made sure that check in was as smooth as possible and made sure we were happy with the villa. The villa was huge with two bed rooms, a living room (with fieplace and heaters) and a private pool ! The resort is huge and beautifully maintained. There is an open zoo that kids would love. The zoo keeper is very efficient with kids and would keep them entertained. We didnt do most of the activities but there is enough for everyone. You can simply walk or hire a bicycle and move around the resorts. Due to winter we couldnt enjoy", " the pool but there are plenty of pools.  Shivam and all the other staff at the Living Room and the lounge (Abdul, sorry I dint remember the names of the others) were very helpful and made sure my 10 month old got whatever was needed. While we ordered ala carte for all meals, Abdul offered us starters and desserts from the buffet. They did not charge for the khicdi made for my younger kid. Food at the Chinse restaurant tasted very good. Chilli chicken was good at the lounge. Since I had a discount on food and beverages, the price actually seemed quiet reasonable. Considering the resort is huge, one would expect delay in housekeeping which was definitely not the case and to our pleasure surprise they were very prompt.  Overall we loved the place and would definitely recommend. ", "We have planned our nearby family trip of 2 days one night and we have searched Five star properties near Delhi NCR. After seeing reviews and availability finally booked Westin Sohna Resort.        Fridabad to Resort road was OK OK types with no good / average dhaba on road. Total dry and backward kind area till we reached Westin Sohna, it is located in surrounded by agriculture fields and dusty area ( No Greens).  Entry of Resort is not very welcoming, parking is almost outside the Hotel boundary and not a gated from other side.          Reception staff was very courteous and helped us to get room keys within 15 minutes ( No Welcome Drink ). We have been transported to our room by a e-golf cart. Driver Mr Samay was a gentleman person and explained the Resort facilities.        ", "  Room was fabulous and bathroom was awesome with bathtub. King size bed with pleasant interior gave cozy feel.         No Mini Bar, No Cookies, No Fruit Basket, Dirty Balconies and No Internet Connection was shoking to us. We called room service and they provided jio dongle which stopped working after 2 hours and repeatedly same.       Room fridge was non functional and after complaining technician visited room and informed that it could not be resolved - another shock.      Few birds, Goat and Rabbit are there and we enjoyed with them. High Tea was arranged near Pool area and was a good experience. Pony Ride was not available.     Property have 1 kids pool and 2 Big pools, Jym Faciliy, Spa, Small Kids Room, open area games ( which can't be played during summer at all) and a Gift Shop. You can take Cycles to visit the property any time.      Restaurant is really awesome and food was great and delicious. Room Service food charges are very very high.      Resort lacks the proper green feelings because lack of watering which we have observed and as informed by gardeners.      There is no lake in this property, only a village pond ( talab) is outside hotel and way to that pond is very dirty and dusty ( not recommended at all).    There is no Para Glyding in Resort, it is run by other people outside property (1 km walk) during morning and evening hours.  Overall Experience is good but we feel that during summer it is not advisable to visit this property. Also at such high terrif Management should make more arrangements in room which are very basic as mentioned above.  Here I have attached few pics that I have taken myself. ", "The reason I rated this hotel 2/5 is because it is an absolutely stunning property. The reason for rating it only 2/5 is because their services completely fails to meet the expectations of an even basic 5 star hotel. More on this as we move forward.  Why I gave this 2 stars and why you must visit this resort - The resort architecture, layout and ambience is absolutely amazing and top notch. The property is spread over 42 acres (!) and kept in prime condition. Kudos to the gardening and resort upkeep staff.  A vast varieties of excursions including paint balling, go karting, cricket ground, vast fields, and beautiful running paths make this property absolutely sublime. The 2 pools are gorgeous and the envy of any resort. Excellent breakfast spread. The grounds are beautifully", " maintained. The peace and tranquility is unparalleled.  After all these glowing remarks, why give it a 2/5 star? Well, to put it simply the services and very basics of any 5 star resort are completely missing! What I did certainly not like- The Wifi is terrible! For a modern day property and that too is the middle of nowhere one would expect some decent Wifi. Well if you are looking to be connected, look elsewhere because the Wifi across the resort is pathetic. There is a complete lack of hygiene in the rooms - towels were stained, bedsheets were stained, laundry bag was stained and everting else was dirty to the core. Hot water took ages to come. Air conditioning was completely inadequate (in fact even my colleagues in other rooms complained of it being shut down at night). Room amenities were pathetic (on one evening I got 2 bathtowels and no hand towers, on the other it was the other way round). No bath mats, no robe and 1 single hangar. One working plug point (!). I mean seriously, any proper hotel has at least 2 plug points for a phone and an iPad / laptop. Lastly, housekeeping randomly entered my room one day without knocking while I was sleeping, looked surprised and slammed the door without even offering an apology! Overall, a beautifully laid out hotel. Unfortunately service standards are no where in line with a Westin and I would definitely not stay there again unless there is a serious improvement in services and basic housekeeping and hygiene. At the end of the day when you pay and stay in a 5 star resort, you expect the basics to be correct.  In a few words, not up to the standards of a Westin brand. ", "The Good: Westin Sohna is a good property which is close to Delhi but not so close as well. It is tucked away in a peaceful corner of Sohna. Good part is that you are away from city's hustle but the bad part is you have nowhere to go incase if you want to step out.  The checkin process was smooth. Kudos to the front desk who helped us complete formalities at the restaurant post our lunch.  They have a zoo, playing area, indoor games, go-kart, paint ball and also a lake. You can rent cycle and explore the property.  Also, they take good precautions during current times. All staff were wearing a mask and the ones at the restaurant were wearing face shields as well. They even told guests to wear masks without any hesitation at the buffet counter which is a good sign as breakfast", " buffets are generally crowded.  The Bad: The property is aged and you'll figure that out once you step in. Its a huge and maintained property but once you step in the room, the property age starts to show. If you are taking the villa, do ensure that couples take up rooms because the bathrooms and washrooms practically have no lock and/or doors.  The Ugly: If you have a dietary requirement like our group who were Jain then there may be some hiccups at the restaurant. Food service seemed slow and during our 4 a la carte meals at the restaurant - the food was mostly average. Considering the price which is at par with any 5 star, we were a bit disappointed with the food.  A shoutout to waiter Atul at the restaurant. He was the saving grace for an otherwise average experience at the restaurant.   Housekeeping was average but they did not bother pick up plates from outside of the room (which was kept by one of their staff members) which looks bad considering Westin is part of the Mariott group and all my experience at their properties have been different than current one.  Overall a decent property for a short getaway from Delhi. Few hiccups here and there - maybe due to staff shortage in current times or maybe they do not care.

Not worth the amount being charged. Won’t come here again neither recommend it to people.", "I’m having a very bad experience at Westin, Sohna  Don’t suggest anyone to come to this property, towels were  dirty, service extremely poor, request to change bathing towels took more than one hour, room was dirty and we had to get it cleaned again when we checked in. Property is good but restaurant was also not clean.   The towels were used ones extremely dirty pics shared. I could never imagine an international chain like Westin (Marriott) can have such a poor cleanliness standards. I’m shocked bathroom has spider webs.  I can understand they are operating during this time but some minimum quality and service standards are expected. I upgraded the room, paid extra for my kid, money is not the issue but very disappointing and unpleasant experience ...

{"place": "Tikli Bottom", "reviews": ["Visited the place for lunch with friends.  Location is near Sohna road in Gurgan-- Google guides the way correctly.  An old Bungalow converted into a quaint place where friends can meet over lunch.  Ms Annie and her team are great hosts looking after the needs of guests.  In winters tables are set around the plunge bath based on bookings. Beverage counter deftly managed by women staff. Dry namkeen available as snacks at the counter.  Lunch served around 1:45, basically a lovely continental spread with dal chawal and noodles included to cater for all palates. The Quiche, tossed salad, grilled fish, pie and ribbed potatoes were out of the world.  Dessert include fruit cream , apple crumble pie and ice cream. This is followed by hot tea or coffee.Food and beverages are self help", " basis.  Lawns are well manicured, and shade n sun aplenty.  Overall a good place to spend a lazy afternoon with friends and family.  Areas for improvement include arrangement of food and beverages  for delayed arrival of guests. Pricing too is on the higher side.", "It's a beautifully done up place.It's quiet and peaceful. It's like visiting an old friend's home..... The rooms are so tastefully done up.  The place has a happy vibe to it.  Must visit once to realise its worth visiting again!", "We spent a lovely afternoon relaxing at Tikkli Bottom with a group of other families, however my young daughter was unfortunate enough to be the recipient of a completely unprovoked attack by the owners' Rottweiler dog which went for her whilst she was walking from the trampoline to the lunch tables. It bit her on the lower leg leaving puncture wounds and bruising. This resulted in the need for hospital visits, rabies jabs and a course of antibiotics… plus a rather abrupt and very unpleasant end to our otherwise enjoyable visit.  I would urge anyone going, especially those with children, to request that the dog is chained up for their safety so that they can enjoy the beauty of the surroundings without worrying about being attacked!", "I travelled to india with my wife and stayed at the house for a week. over this time period we thought that martin was abnoxious, rude, unwelcoming, very creepy, arrogant and sadly racist. there were a few young english volunteers working there at the school and it seemed as if they were all miserable and that martin was treating them horribly.  this house also does not have basic neccesaties such as enough hot water for two, wifi and anything remotley expected in a normal hotel let alone one costing this much money .", "I am a very fair person. I enjoyed Tikli Bottom's location and clean air. Martin (the owner) was fun to talk to. The people working are extremely nice as well. Helpful and sweet. HOWEVER, what happened that weekend with no apologies from the Martin was just very disturbing.   We spent a night at Tikli Bottom. Most of my friends have been there for day visits and recommended it. At dinner, their dog, who you have read about in many other reviews, BIT my face. Normally when someone owns a dog that is even slightly ferocious, warning signs are present. DON'T pet the dog. Beware of the dog. Something to warn visitors to not be too friendly. I can say that the entire weekend, which by the way was EXPENSIVE, was hurt by my going to the hospital the next morning for anti rabies shots. ", " It is normal for me to expect some form of an apology after spending the evening with a slightly swollen face and multiple injections the next day. That didn't happen. Instead, at lunch the next day, my mother fell into a chair which lost it's seat. Again, the response from Martin was so disheartening that we left feeling very disrespected.  The owners should understand that these things are no longer acceptable. You have to know what good hospitality really means. You cannot just have a beautiful place that is run with zero emotions. I wish none of this had happened, but it did. And more than anything I am saddened by it all. Especially the way I was treated.", "I have nothing nice to say about this place because as a customer in this day and age I expect quality and most of all good service, especially if I am paying a premium. This place fails on both counts. Tikli Bottom is positioned as a guest house which runs by its own ‘house rules’, which is perfectly acceptable, however, there are limits to rigidity and arrogance.   Here are just some of the issues I faced- my wife was attached / bitten by a seemingly unharmful pet Rottweiler, post which we were told by the staff that the dog had attacked atleast four staff members in the not so recent past. Forget about an apology (which I really don’t care for), I strongly suggest that the owners put up a warning for their guests or take some caution like not letting the animal loose around", " guests. We were never warned.  Next afternoon at the lunch my elderly mother had a close call when the chair at the dining table broke and she fell off it. When we informed the owner, he first refused to accept that something like that could happen and then conveniently blamed it on some guest who might have damaged the chair. No apology again. All of this along with a sarcastic and almost condescending attitude just makes the entire experience a bad one.   It seems like the owners are using this ‘take it or leave it’ attitude to maintain exclusivity which unfortunately ends up giving a terribly negative vibe.", "\"Day visitors are welcome,' the website said, so we drove out intrigued by the name and spent a long time looking for it -- only to be met by a glacial man and a slightly less hostile woman \"this is a guest house, and if you email us ahead of time we will decide if we will invite you or not.\" Dear unfriendly 'hosts,' put that in BIG letters on your website, would you? Obviously we would not be so tempted ever after that sentence (though it looked pretty enough), but it clearly seemed a space run by foreigners for other foreigners, not for us seemingly Indian bodies. Thanks but no thanks.", "first, the place is far too expensive for what it is: Euro200 for a B&B (even if food is included) is a rip off for indian standards. Better place to stay at: Pataudi Palace, also close to Delhi, and a truly magical (and better value) experience - a Neemrana hotel. Second, you feel the owners of Tikli Bottom (a 65+ y o brit couple) have opened the house for their own personnal entertainment - or else they'd be bored... so they'll expect to do the conversation around the dining table  Third, am not sure the owners have a \"current\" approach to India's culture, clearly despising their welcoming country. Some comments were clearly unsettling for us (\"we wear the traditional outfit whenever we need to play indians\", \"this is india\" looking at our very helpful driver with desdain,", " etc). Is it bitterness? Clearly, colonial times are gone... Some people regret that. Still, if you guys were heading back to the UK, you would not have 8 or 9 servants working for you... so think positive!  Further, you might want to go there if you want to have a laugh at the owners' expense - be aware that the laugh will be on you when the bill comes... here entertainment doesnt come cheap  Else, the place is nice and clean but you'll be bored after 2 hours - once you've said hi to the owners' cows, there's nothing to do", "Surrounded by the Aravalli Hills, this Lutyens-style country house has lovely rooms , deep verandahs and friendly staff. It is close to the Delhi airport though present in the Delhi-NCR. With presence of Delhi Metro it has become easy to reach Gurgaon, You can spend a lovely weekend over here. Its is run by a charming English couple, Annie and Martin Howard. You need to take an off country drive to reach this place, but when you are here you'll forget  everything.", "Tb is home to Martin & Annie Howard – octogenarian English couple, who “appear” to be friendly & warm.  Though they’ve described tb as ‘haveli’ on the website, it’s just a big house.  Undoubtedly, well maintained with surrounding garden full of b’ful blooms & a mini swimming pool.  Architecture – erstwhile raj.    First trip was for Sunday luncheon with friends.  Reaching tb has been a nightmare, & it’s status quo.  Basic home-made affair with little or no choice for a vegetarian.  The lemonade, sugar syrup etc. to somehow make the cocktails were stored in very old, over-used plastic bottles of Pepsi & Coca Cola.  Grossly unhygienic & even poisonous.    Second trip was for a weekend.  Scenic calm & green – big draw for anyone living in Delhi – NCR.  Called Martin, & he asked to", " send mail.  Gave detailed info that am a pure vegetarian (not even eggs) & my friend is lactose intolerant.  Asked him clearly reg no. of meals that will be provided, in & out timings etc. He confirmed booking & said “…food no problem”.  Called after 2 days around 1545 hrs for some other queries.  He curtly informed he is having lunch, which am ‘intruding’, just send mail.  His tone was rude & uninviting.  This is how you’ll be treated as a potential guest with a sky-high tariff.  Crux – contact them for inquiry(s) or booking only via mail.  No phone calls pls.  You’d be ‘intruding’, & thus liable to be insulted.  You may get a call en-route from a lady staff at tb enquiring about your booking, whether for a day or two, how many people, what type of rooms | beds | eating preferences, time of arrival etc.  Be prepared to rattle off all details again which you’d have already ‘emailed’ to Martin, & also received confirmation.  Efficient staff or double check or plain lack of co-ordination at tb end.  You’d be left with a germ of doubt – is our booking really confirmed?    On reaching, there’s no designated car park.  Two cars are parked in the driveway.  No one will greet you at the door.  Then suddenly, a very old lady staff will appear, welcome you in best practised lines & insist on taking your luggage.  One would of course not load the old lady with luggage.  We carried ours.  Upon entering, there’s a huge living space full of memorabilia, photos, a table full of b’day cards of Annie, few bottles of home-made marmalade, honey, & other knick-knacks.  Both Annie & Martin met us with warmth & enthusiasm.  Since we started early, so were hungry.  On asking for b’fast, we were told we will get coffee & sandwich.  Fine.  Annie insisted we have it in the ‘fire’ room.  Being polite guests, we obliged silently.  Annie came in to give us company, & had coffee with us.  Very nice.  Few hours were to go b/w early b’fast & lunch.  On being asked for something to eat around noon, the staff politely discouraged, informing lunch will be served shortly.  Instead gave us some mixture.  Drinks offered repeatedly by the staff were either ‘bloody mary’ or ‘gin tonic’.  Lunch was served around 45 mins later than designated time.  It comprised of – fish cakes, a veg & a non-veg salad, crudely baked pizza-sort-of-a-thing with sparse toppings of barista (fried onions), mushroom & green capsicum, baked potatoes (only saving grace), rice & kofta (onion pakodas in half-cooked gravy smelling of raw masala & oil).  Host Martin insisted on serving each guest – even when it was a ‘buffet’.  We know what it means.  Or was the intent different?  Dessert – tiny strawberries (as Annie likes them) with buffalo milk.  Was it a crude way of presenting strawberries with clogged cream, popular in UK?  Wine served was Sula white & red – most basic.  Again, nothing much to eat being a vegetarian.  It was just the start of disappointment.  Throughout lunch, all were expected to chit-chat politely with complete strangers.  Sort of getting to know each other at the school mess chaired by Martin & Annie at either ends.  As we politely engaged in it, one of the lady staff came up to Martin holding a dirty part of washing machine asking to sort out some problem.  Very uncalled for action.  Post lunch, as chit-chat was still on, Annie loudly complained to one of the guests that this problem in washing machine, & whites that she got from Britain turned ‘yellow’ is due to “Indian Surf” that the house staff is very fond of using.  It was a racist comment.  Though she ‘appeared’ to be educated, but ignorant.  “Surf” is the brand name of detergent powder manufactured & marketed by Unilever.  Unilever is a British-Dutch transnational consumer goods company co-headquartered in London & Rotterdam.  Think before you speak – atleast once!  At the dinner table, I was made to sit on a small chair w/o handles, my friend was offered the ‘actual dining table chair’.  Weird – was it because chairs are limited or broken.  Dinner was served around 1945 hrs, comprising of chicken, mashed potatoes, boiled & lightly sautéed purple cabbage, and some cheese laden dish with miniature pieces of mushroom & onion was served to me.  Serving staff enquired again if am the odd one out in the group i.e. vegetarian.  Wine served was same as lunch.  There was nothing substantial to eat for me.  I kept quiet & hungry.    Some ‘civil’ points now.  Power went off multiple times after sun down.  Lights in the bathroom & dressing room conked off, never to be bothered with again.  Matchsticks provided refused to work. In the spacious bathroom, WC will always flood over when flushed, along with its content.  There are separate taps for hot & cold water – wonderful.  But, errr….no mixer in between.  Either you freeze or burn.  Shower will throw more water out of tub than on you.  You should have a good aim to get showered completely.    Only best thing happened is next day morning, I got a cup of coffee on request.  Warm drinking water was also made available.  There was a bed warmer thankfully, but a non-working oil heater.  B’fast was again disappointing.  We were informed – we will get what we want, it’ll be freshly made.  My friend got brown bread whole wheat toast with egg & bacon, but I received white bread sandwiches when I politely told the staff prior that I want brown bread as well.  When I asked for some Indian b’fast, the demi cook rolled his eyes at the clock (10 o’clock) & refused.  At the round table beside the kitchen we had b’fast, a maid came & started washing mop cloth in the sink. It was hardly a foot away.  Grossly unhygienic.  Annie came in again, gave us company.    We had to eat only during the time house owners were eating.  No meal or food was provided beside that.  Staff is well trained in politely refusing, discouraging any food in between.  We always, always had some company during meal times.  It was extremely annoying.  One of the critics of tb in her post rightly said – “owners of tb have opened it up for their own entertainment”.  At departure, Martin asked only my friend to put a note in the guest book.  I was coldly ignored.  Misogynist or plain ol’ world – whatever, absolutely not welcome.  Some people seem to be living in a bygone era.    So, if you’d like to shell out the price of one night at a plush 7 star hotel but get treatment, food & drinks worst than an Air BnB or Oyo Rooms, please experience the bottom of service & hospitality at tb.

{"place": "Gajner Palace Hotel", "reviews": ["Gajner palace is the old hunting palace restored in accurate fashion to its former glory. Its evident that the restoration put emphasis on the colonial decoration and interior design. This includes room designs and layouts, sinks etc. The exterior is also restored to give the grandeur this place once enjoyed some good resemblance. Right at arrival you will be greeted with loud chirping from all the birds that are around. There were so many birds around you were almost worried to stand under trees for too long. The trees, some of which are 150 years old, are magnificent. Peacocks are around as well but you may have to venture out a little to see them.   A cultural show is offered in the evening. If you have stayed anywhere else in rajasthan it will be the same/very similar.   ", " The restaurant prices are expectantly steep given the somewhat remote location. A vegetarian thali is approximately 1100 rupees with soups being around 300 rupees. Soup sizes are pretty large and come in plates as opposed to small bowls. The staff is absolutely amazing and will try to meet your every need. The soups were good and the food can be catered to almost every pellet.

Stayed in the Deluxe Room... comfortable, with all the standard facilities. Considering that it is a Government hotel, the services provided are quite good. Staff is responsive. Menu offered is basic but food was tasty (opted for Inian-Kerala cuisine). Overall, perfect choice for a hotel in its class.  ", "I'm in two minds about this place... It's in a jewel of a location but its difficult to get to, it not served by any public transport (even the ferries ignore it) and it's appearances belie its somewhat tawdry state. My diary entry runs thus: Bolgaty Palace is a tired pile with colonial aspirations but she’s not too dissimilar to the try-hard model that just can't quite put all the artful pieces together, and her aspirational glamour is lost in the ill fitting shoes, running makeup and the split seams. Which is to say the hotel complex in the middle of Kochi Harbour lacks internet, had a bar without spirits, bathrooms of musty mustiness and doors that don’t quite close. Tiles are loose, wiring exposed, and water stains tell us the roof needs repair. Did I mention where it sits?", " In the middle of Kochi Harbour with a view down the harbour's gun barrel entrance and past Fort Kochi where Vasco de Gama was once buried. The model, despite all the trimmings being tawdry, has a stunning figure...that still catches the eye.\" Our second visit to Kochi with more planned - we will start somewhere else next time.", "I stayed for a couple of weeks at Bolgatty Palace in 1968. My room was on the first floor at the front, that gave way to a gigantic veranda. I slept in a four poster bed with curtains around it. I loved the Palace and the food was great.

There are four suites in the old building (huge and wooden although with no private balconies), six cottages right on the water's edge with their own balconies and about ten rooms in a more modern block with balconies. The staff are very suite although not always very clued-up.  There is a small but good swimming pool surrounded by trees. The location is superb - at the end of Bolgatty Island completely removed from Fort Cochin and from the nasty Erakulam area. This is its greatest advantage but also means that you have to plan transport a little.  The hotel will take you for free in a boat to Erakulam but for Fort Cochin it pays to shell out 250Rp for a speed boat to take you over and a 50Rp tip to ensure that the", " driver is at the jetty to pick you up at a pre-arranged time.

You could also help yourself to glasses of prosecco every morning which was a lovely and very welcoming touch :)   The hotel doesn't  have a bar but there are many bars /restaurants nearby also a couple of shops if you needed anything.

One caveat: the hotel taxi within the city limits is really overpriced.", "A lovely hotel 50 meters from the Charles Bridge. Perfect location. The reception staff is wonderful.

Its on the same style as B R Hills camp also belonging to Jungle Lodges.  Food is adequate and service was good.

Apart from this, white water rafting is another activity they have there..

The palace, built in the mid-19c-century by a German architect, looks impressive, but  is so austere, that it would have been better used as a court-house than a hotel. The grounds lack greenery, we had a view towards a rather ugly parking-lot. On the other side was something of a park, which in the evenings apparently gets often used for parties.  The rooms were the darkest we have seen anywhere. We were shown more than one room after we complained and ended up in a corner suite. To make everything even darker than necessary the rather small windows had milk-glass as if in a bath-room. So no views either, only from the veranda in front", " of the suite. Mosquito-nets instead of milk-glass would have been preferred, since of all places this also had the most mosquitoes (together with the palace-hotel in Gondal).  The suite had a mixture of old and new furniture, there was a rug and the decoration on the walls consisted mainly of old faded fotos of the local Maharaja-family. Very positive were the many plugs (for camera, mobile, I-pad), the fridge, the tea-and-coffee-making facilities, the separate dressing-room with a big mirror and the plenty of storage-place in the bathroom. But sanitary installations there were quite old.  The best part about the hotel was the dinner, although the dining hall with four tables seating six persons each is not very cozy for a couple. But it had a palace-feeling especially with the three big chandeliers.  Service was efficient anf friendly. There are two menu-cards (veg and non-veg). The 'chicken lemon coriander soup' and the 'chicken tandoori with green masala' I had one evening were very good. They are also very generous, when it comes to serving extra limes.  WiFi was promised near reception, but it never worked during our two-days stay.  The worst about the hotel was the swimming-pool. It is a nice-looking place, buit in the same style as the palace, but about 200 meters away. Several men are on duty at the pool, which also has showers and changing-rooms, but no towels for the guests. They made me call reception, who promised me a towel right away. 20 minutes later nothing had arrived yet, so I went to the reception to ask about it. 'Oh, sorry, Sir. I forgot about it. Go back to the pool, we will bring one now'. It was the same. Again I returned to the reception. Same answer. So I said: 'This time I want the towel right here'. And immediately it was brought. In general I had the impression that a lot of staff just hangs around without much motivation.  Back at the pool I saw that the pool gets mainly used by people from the city, not the hotel guests. There were several kids and women bathing with all their clothes on. What surprised me was the fact that nobody took a shower beforehand.

Guests forgive the hotel the faults, the minor discomforts, the lack of professional service and the unreliable hot water or unreliable wi-fi because they make up in atmosphere what they lack in five star standards.  Roopangarh Fort Hotel fits this profile.   Those intending to stay should have modest expectations and read the reviews with care.    The best point about the property is that it is absolutely full of character.    It is a palace/fort with large terraces and spaces.  Wide galleries overlook the", " interior of the palace grounds and surrounding village from the second floor.  There is a striking white mausoleum-like temple on a raised dais at the end of the tennis-court/football ground main terrace.  The rooms are all different and some (such as the Maharani’s Suite and Room 3) are enormous.  Among the family heirlooms that decorate the palace there are some charming items as well as decaying vitrines of Victorian tobacco tins, mediaeval weapons, and rusty padlocks.  Some parts of the property are well restored and others are ramshackle.  The surrounding grounds are neglected on the whole.  Bathrooms are generally modern and well appointed with hot-water immersion heaters but eccentric flow.  The beds have clean linen and are fine if firm.  The staff are local men who are untrained and not very fluent in English (or French or German) but who are willing and try to please and satisfy the needs of guests.  They have had considerable experience and can generally work out what it is that guests need.  We stayed four years ago and wrote an enthusiastic review for TripAdvisor.  The guest book is full of fulsome praise for the property and the staff.  Some aspects of the property are truly splendid.  As another previous reviewer wrote, there is not a lot to do or see at Roopangarh.  The tour of the village was very interesting in 2011, with its artisans making jewelry for the pricy shops of Jaipur.  We found that rarest of things – Rajasthani bargains on our last stay here.  Alas, no more.  That cottage industry has vanished from the village and moved to more profitable pastures.  You can have a village visit but it hardly differs from the hundreds of similar visits on offer throughout the country.  We found our village tour unremarkable - some children asking for pens and everyone wanting their photographs taken.  The villagers are not rapacious or pestering but neither are they unaware of tourists.  The region is noted for its marble quarries and factories.  If marble is your thing you can visit the marble factories though you cannot avoid seeing them on the ten kilometers or so from the highway as you drive to the village.  As for the down-side of the stay at the fort, the food is okay.  Breakfast is uninspired.  The new wi-fi introduced in 2014 didn’t work for us at all.  The property is a maze of high stairs and steps so it is not for the less than nimble.  We were pleased to be remembered by the staff who looked after us four years ago.  They did their best to make us feel at home.", "The sun was going down as we drove, with difficulty, through Roopangarh's main street, ultra-narrow in places where shops and houses encroached onto the grubby roadway, making it necessary for our driver to brake hard or back up if even a motorbike came towards us. The road lead only to the Fort named after the town (or should that be the other way around?). There, the driver's skills were put to the test by a winding entrance gate designed to thwart attackers on elephant-back. Several three-point turns later, we unloaded our bags at the foot of the steps up to the imposing palace, for this was where we were to spend the night. With hindsight, perhaps we should have planned to stay longer here. It was to prove one of many highlights of our tour so far.  The fort and the palace", " inside it were originally built by Maharajah Roop Singh in the 17th century on a strategic hilltop controlling the trade route to Sambhar Salt Lake. In 1999, the present maharajah opened it as a hotel, leaving the interior and exterior little changed. Let's be clear about one thing - the fort has been renovated, not restored, so it retains its ancient space and character, warts and all!  It has 20 rooms, some of which are former royal suites with antique furniture and colourful traditional furnishings - like the two vast rooms we were given. They appeared sparsely furnished, not surprising really as each was the size of a soccer pitch with a ceiling so incredibly high that you'd need scaffolding just to do the dusting. There was a terrace at the front to catch the sunrise and another one at the back for sunset. In one wall of each was a window looking down onto the hotel's restaurant, for the rooms were once the maharanis' domains and they'd have used the windows to peer down onto what was then the Durbar Hall to see what the maharajah and his chums were up to.  In the courtyard, we enjoyed a rest on wicker chairs drawn up around a fire pit before an enjoyable evening meal. Nearby was a tennis court, sometimes used for cricket too, and a terrace where noisy peacocks roamed in the early morning sun. One of the friendly staff proudly showed us the Queen's Suite - a huge, ornate room with an equally huge bathroom, a gallery above and a staircase to a private roof terrace. Maybe we'll book that next time.  Early next morning, we ventured forth into the town just as the little shops started to open their doors. A few people sat outside reading newspapers, pigs scavenged among yesterday's detritus, and motorcyclists sped through the empty main street on their way to who knows where. The shopkeeper with his display of sweets and snacks, initially unsmiling and curious, was happy to have his photograph taken - as were the barber with his first customer of the day at his open-fronted shop, the lady selling nothing but bangles, and the elderly gent with ragged red turban and grey whiskers. A lad, smartly dressed in his Modern Public School uniform, politely asked, in impeccable English, for his photo to be taken. It seems likely that few tourists spend time wandering around the town interacting with the local people, for they were so genuinely pleased to stop whatever they were doing to spend a moment talking and laughing with us.  We would have liked another hour or two here but had to be on our way. Next time, we'll stay much, much longer.", "Spacious rooms and modern fixtures, fitting for a building that used to be a raja’s palace.

Thankful to have you in my life....x", "This place was a perfect example of what is being presented and marketed in the website being far away from what you really get. We had booked the Kapha room which was then advertised as being in the ground floor but was actually in the basement (they seem to have subsequently changed the description to basement in the website now after repeated complaints). We landed there expecting a lovely room in the ground floor and to our chagrin found ourselves in a dingy basement. But no, the series of shocks did not end there and we were in for much more horrors. They have a sanitation problem in the pipes situated in the basement and the entire area had a terrible stench of sewage throughout our 5 day stay.The room had no ventilation, very stuffy coupled with the sewage smell and the", " table fan that was reluctantly placed there on day 2 after many complaints did nothing to allay this but just circulated the air within. The fact that they have a sewage problem was admitted by the lady who runs it but she was very nonchalant about it and totally indifferent to our plight. To add to the terrible smell  we got up in the morning to discover most  of the basement covered with terrible smelling water.We thankfully discovered it before it flooded our room. After pointing it out to the gardner, he called someone to clean up the water but the leakage had intensified the already existing stench even more. To our  greatest horror there were cockroaches (Yes COCROACHES unbelievable isnt it?)both outside and inside the room, I have killed at least 6 cockroaches with my shoes.   The room was reasonably well decorated but with cockroaches, sewage smell and no ventilation forgive us if we failed to appreciate it!  The refrigerator was placed in the bathroom, we couldn't imagine placing any food or drink there for obvious hygiene reasons.  I think the other rooms might have been less problematic than Kapha.The entire place is overpriced by Canaries' standards   The only positive I can say about it is that the common areas are done tastefully to give a tranquil feeling and there is nice plank to do yoga. But again given the room and the nonchalance of the lady who runs it, we were in a total state of shock and disbelief to spend time there. The pool area looked good but again water wasn't too clean.  We did not try the food there as we were thoroughly upset and shocked with the room and did not want to try the overpriced food. I did talk to the cook as  she kindly allowed me to use the hob to make my  ayurvedic medicine. The cook is a lovely person but I cannot sadly say the same about the lady who runs it or the place as such. I did not try the yoga there but from whatever I could surmise from the limited conversation there and from my reasonably good knowledge of  yoga, it seemed a typical case of someone who knows very little about it selling it to people who know nothing about it. However as I didn't try it, I reserve judgement on it.  Location again is far from civilisation and a struggle for those without a car. Be aware that the spa though nice is located at quite a distance and location wise is nowhere close to the house where you stay. you need to take a taxi to go there or walk up to a bus stop about 12  minutes away and wait for infrequent buses. To their credit, I can say that spa was quite good.  The playa paraiso is not too thrilling a beach and there are far lovelier ones in other areas. There are hardly any restaurants even near the spa, so you need to go to main Tenerife and end up wasting half a day for just going out for a meal.  To sum up, the worst stay we have ever had and it ruined a trip which would have otherwise perfect. Still regret choosing this terrible place", "Do not eat at the Villa Dhanvantari as you will be very disappointed in the quality and value for money.

After the first backtreatment, I felt that something had changed.. I walked differently, \"lighter\" than before..   So - although I initially was at te villa to do yoga, eat healthy and relax - I decided to have 2 more backtreatments. Now it feels like I have a new body, two weeks after the treatments I am improving every day, I feel my body is \"setting\" and correcting itself..

A refreshing welcome drink was missing. 2. Cottages: The cottages were quite big enough with the bath tubs, in some rooms, in the back open area of the room was exciting. The cots were very comfortable. However, the bathrooms needs to be updated. The House Keeping supervisors Mr. Madhu and another were very cooperative and tried to understand our needs well. 3. Swimming Pool: Quite a cool pool with a uniform depth of 4.5 ft and a small children pool. We did enjoy the pool on the", " second day as the pool was not operational on the day of our arrival 4. Restaurant: Food served on Al Carte was very good and tasty. The Chef and supervisor Mr. Anand enquired with us on all days what best they could serve us. They did a good job.

We  were not at all disappointed on what we expected and all of us thoroughly enjoyed our stay there. Every thing about our stay was good, including hotel room facilities, restaurant, the lush green and spectacular surroundings spread over a vast area adjacent to beach( Bay of bengal), the swimming pool and the special cultural events they organised for the Pongal festival.. Children had  the best opportunities for running around, playing games and swimming pool.We had witnessed the sun set in the sea in the midst of coconut trees. There were stone sculptures all ", " over. You have the option of staying in cottages or hotel rooms.  Since it was festival time we had to book in advance. The tariff for the hotel room accomodation was Rs.7500/-per double room per day which we all felt as bit exorbitant. But may be,it was due to the days of festival season.  The reception staff were very good, spacious room facilities such as bed, linen, toileteries . The only unsatisfactory part is the Bar which had none of the brands of liquors they had in their menu, plus the lack of short eats. they need to improve on the bar if they want foreign visitors to stay there. The restaurant  food and varieties in the complementary breakfast was OK.", "We just stayed for one night wherein the rooms are good and a little bit old property yet to concentrate on maintenance.  since the occupant is very less there was no buffet dinner but the restaurant manager prepared good food and served us very hot.

It has also had a private beach which is very good we did enjoy the swimming pool as well. very nice lawn and overall we had a very good experience ..", "A large group of my family and friends stayed at the resort for my daughter’s wedding. The wedding was mostly lovely although they spelled my name wrong on the large sign at the entrance to the reception. The restaurant, where we were excited to host dinner for the wedding guests the night before the reception, only had about 1/3 of the items listed on the menu available. This was disappointing and embarrassing. However the main issues were our accommodations. We were told our rooms would accommodate 3 people which we learned when we arrived was a mattress on the floor for the 3rd person. The bathroom flooded every time we showered, housekeeping never came to make up any of our rooms, and we had to ask for clean towels instead of them being exchanged in our room.

On the second night of our stay, the power went out in our room and we had to move to another room late at night. The power went on and off in our new room too which was a problem for me as I sleep with a breathing machine. I explained this to the manager and asked for some refund at least for the night with the power issues but he tried to sweet talk me about how nice their location is next to the beach. He faulted me for not bringing some of the other issues to his attention sooner and indicated that these things wouldn’t be a problem for Indian guests, but were for me since I am a foreigner. He never agreed to any portion of a refund. The accommodations at this resort were the most we paid at any place on our two week journey and were definitely the worst! Would recommend staying elsewhere!", "Stay away!! That would be my piece of advise. The rooms may be big and spacious, but the service and staff are pathetic.  The housekeeping or room service never answers phone call.  The house keeping or the reception lady did not know where the switches for the geyser was. The TV does not work and nothing was done about it. The toaster near the breakfast buffet does not work! If you order medu vada through room service, you will get them without sambhar and chutney.

You can read reviews, look at videos on YouTube, and get an overload of 1st hand information. Taj Falaknuma is immune to all of this. Although I read a lot about the experience, when my wife and I actually checked in, I am glad to say that it was so unique and distinct.  I understand that you have a template of activities in place that you have perfected, and this was evident with the precision shown by all the employees - The arrival, spa, evening tour, qawali performance, peacock feeding, welcome cake, farewell cake, etc... But what set you apart from the rest is your empathy. You understood my every need.  When I called up saying I am hungry and need a jar of cookies before the", " palace tour, you ran to my doorstep in 5 mins.  When I said No to dessert, you suggested a palate cleanser sorbet nonetheless.  When I asked for a watermelon juice, you just brought it over without charging me.  When I asked for details of the bathrobe I wanted to buy, your housekeeping manager found us - repeat: found us and gave us details. Later, one of your colleagues too found us in the palace and handed us an envelope with contact details.  When I said that I wanted to takeaway a Milkshake from breakfast, you brought it to my table, and what's more, you asked my wife what she wanted and kept giving options patiently till she said yes to Coconut water.  Your food is very tasty. It is absolutely a Royal experience to have stayed with you. We were treated like Royalty and spoilt for choice.  Everyone knew my wife's birthday, right from the person who opened our car door. You even paid attention to detail and understood from my Adhaar card that it was my birthday the earlier day and wished me as well.  If I have to be candid, I thought the room experience could have been slightly better. The walls were a bit damp and I could observe water seepage on walls, but it's a 130 year old building, so not complaining too much. Also, the night light could have been slightly brighter, and the mini bar could have been stocked up with drinks along with some snacks.  Your concierge Megha was amicable and proactive.  Your coordinator Mr. KV Rao was suggested by her, and he turned out to be a magician who can work his magic on any phone he sets his hands on. I cannot take a good photograph due to lack of interest and competency. He had both. He gave us a great professional photoshoot and arranged props for us to get memorable shots.  Your waiters and restaurant managers are very polite and jump to address your every concern.  I enjoyed the dining experience in Celeste (since we couldn't eat a heavy dinner that day) and I look forward to returning to your Palace to dine at Adaa.

Always smiling and open to any feedback I had and ensuring my son got the food he wanted, even if it meant packing it for us to take along when we stepped out.  The only room for improvement in my opinion would be the food. It lacked consistency. We would like something and end up ordering it again and it would taste completely different, including something as basic as a Khichadi. We tried both, the Cntinental and Indian cuisine and I'd rate it an 8/10 as against the rest of our experience which was definitely a 10/10.

Telangana Tourism also takes you for the Taj Falaknuma tour which does not last more than 20 minutes. But for this too one has to pay 2500/- just to take the Palace tour.  The Falaknuma Palace is indeed a beautiful property and kudos to the Taj group of hotels for refurbishing this property which took more than 10 years.   We signed up for the palace tour through Telangana Tourism which took us to Falaknuma around 3.20 PM. Just outside the main building one has to wait till the tour which begins at 3.30. We clicked a few pics of the entrance. However they are very strict and do not allow wander  or going anywhere.   At 3.30, their", " concierge Ms Deepa came at the entrance to begin the tour. Even though there was a group of 40+ people, the tour was just one. They could have easily divided the group into two so that everyone could enjoy the tour. However everyone was clubbed and standing quite close to each other to hear the tour.  The tour lasts for just 20 minutes. The tour traveses just at the start  of the property where they take you to the Nizams office, the drawing room, the entertainment room, the 108 dining table and the princess room. The property is quite big but I'm disappointed that neither did they share more information nor do they take you around the palace.  Ms Deepa was more concerned that the attendees of the tour did not take pics/ vidoes. This was quite strange when the internet is flooded with pics and videos of visitors who have  posted about the same when they have taken such a tour before. Upon completing the 20 minute tour, we were asked to leave immediately, as though we were some kind of untouchables and this property is only reserved for the elites.   No doubt the property is beautiful, but we did not have the time nor the space to soak in experience. Even though we paid a good amount through Telangana tourism, we found our experience to be a rip off.  Attitude of the hotel management and Telangana tourism seems to be offering just a glimpse of this property. Having visited many palaces around India, we could not experience the grandeur of Falknama. Unfortunately this was a dampener for us.

This was the first holiday my parents took in the last 2 years or so and the team went out of their way to make their experience special.

The checkin was amongst the smoothest I've experienced during the Covid years when in room check ins seem to have been discontinued. The entire experience of being brought into the palace on a horse drawn carriage was exquisite.  An oft overlooked department by me - the house keeping team here was standout. Ms. Mounika ditched the usual towel swans in favour of a towel cake since we were celebrating a birthday and then went out of her way to continually impress all along the length of our stay. Overall the attention to detail of the house keeping team was impressive. The IRD team(Shreyansh), F&B team at the restaurants during dinner as well as a busy breakfast service were standout. My mum is vegetarian and the team remembered that when they bought some special eggless desserts for her. Since we mentioned we were going to be taking a day excursion they packed some fruits for us as well. The F&B manager during the breakfast service whose name I forget was amazing.  Honestly each member of the staff deserves to be called out by their names for the phenomenal service we got and there isn't  a single flaw I could find for this entire trip.

The second and third night, we asked for a different room and were allotted one on the first floor. We were surprised to see AC in the living room and the furnishings seemed newer compared to the ground floor room. Hot water was available in this room from the tap.  The whole campus was buzzing with mosquitoes and we had to ask for a mosquito repellent. I will not be exaggerating when I say that there must be thousands of mosquitoes over the place.  The earlier reviews have thrashed the restaurant in the campus but we had a pleasant experience here. The variety was limited but the food was good and the service prompt. But yes the morning breakfast was erratic. One day we go the breakfast at 745 am. The second day it was not ready even until 830 am.  All the staff were polite and helpful and gave what you asked for. But the point is that You had to ask. You had to ask for the towels, for the mosquito repellant etc.  The hotel is situated around 25 min drive from the airport by taxi. The prepaid taxi from the airport charged us Rs.600/-. Rickshaws could be got from outside the hotel. They were charging approximately 250 to go to Begumpet or Hussain Sagar lake.

Though the property is very well laid out with lots open space, gardens for kids to play around, ample car parking space and even a swimming pool, where it lets itself down is because of it's horrible service and choice of food.  During the day time though you'll find some staff to get things you need (but after repeated request), from the evening no one is available in the reception. So after you've looked for the staff around you've to finally walk to", " the restaurant - which is about 300 meters away from the main building and you may find the hotel staff there in the kitchen having a nice time with the restaurant staff.  As to the restaurant, most of the items in the menu are not available and surprisingly you are in Hyderabad and they won't prepare Biriyani of any sort, even if you request then to and even though it appears in the menu. So is the case with any Kababs or Tandoor items you are looking for - none are available. If your hotel booking has included complimentary breakfast, please be ready for a decent shock, almost nothing is available except \"Idli\". We stayed for 3 days and only on the first day few puris were served along with Idli and it stopped from the second day. There was no other option of any South/North Indian/Continental breakfast. And remember we visited in December and there was a decent number of guest in the hotel, so any excuse of lack of enough guest, is not acceptable.  The attitude of the restaurant staff towards the guest of the hotel was that, as if they were doing a great favour by giving the guest the breakfast for free as it is complimentary. I believe someone should have the sense to understand, the price of the food is actually included in the room rate and technically nothing is free. The undue advantage the restaurant has is due the outskirt locality, there is no restaurant or snacks outlet nearby to grab a quick bite - unless of course you are smart enough to pick up some food on your way.  As far as cleanliness is concerned, the rooms and the other areas of the property are quite clean and well maintained including the gardens, however the same can't be said about the linens. Though freshly washed linens are provided when the guest moves in, but the linens were very old and stained, which I wouldn't expect from a mid range hotel. I don't expect new linens to be bought for every new guest, but it is also not acceptable to provide linens which were stained and years old.  Overall I think this property of Telengana Tourism can be turned into a great place to stay in Hyderabad city, if the staff can be more professional, regular check on the quality of linens and the restaurant is stuffed with more choice of food and courteous staff.

When I asked for omelette, waiter comes to me and says \"sir please don't order else others will also ask for omelette. I can send it to your room\" my next reaction was \" why would I have it in room if I am having my breakfast here, isn't it included\" he says \"no sir, it's chargeable\"  This breakfast service made me realize how breakfast plays and important role in making guest happy or sad.

When I asked, after lunch, that if there is a facility of providing finger bowls, the waiter confirmed it, resulting us not to leave the table and wash our hands. after 15 minutes, 4 finger bowls[out rightly dirty] were served with chilling cold water, against 8 of us people. I wondered, calculated again and asked for 4 more bowls, after about 10 minutes 2 more bowls got served with the water with same temperature as earlier.

The white palace glistening on Lake Pichola is breathtaking, and the arrival experience is genuinely wonderful (the raining rose petals are very unassuming so it feels elegant, rather than in your face and awkward).   Our room, a palace-facing lake view room, was simply beautiful. We ended up being moved to a much bigger room (more on this later), and I was actually sad to leave our more basic one behind with its intimate appointments, period features, and subtle grandeur.   The bar and signature drinks had to be the best I’ve had in a long time. We tried many, and they were all exceptional. The music in the bar was a little strange at times, but didn’t spoil the incredible setting and", " fantastic cocktails.   Service at the Lake Palace was excellent. Jheel in the Indian restaurant remembered exactly what we ate each night, which was an experience I’ve never had at any hotel. Friends who previously stayed here said the food wasn’t great, but actually, we stayed at many very highly rated/famous hotels in India on this trip, and the food was the best here. The laal maas (recommended by Jheel) was the best we tried in Rajasthan even.   My one complaint with this property is that it’s insanely noisy. I hardly slept at all the three nights we spent there. Whether it was the birds in the courtyard, noise from the event they had going on, or the live performances, this is not a hotel you should expect to relax much at. Night two was too much for me, after trying to sleep a bit during the day from a sleepless night before, but being unable to from all the noise in the courtyard, drilling coming from another room, and furniture moving above us all day. The manager kindly and very quickly moved us to a suite, which was very large, but I have to say, I’d have rather moved to our same room category in a quieter part of the hotel. This room change resulted in us sacrificing our nice view for a view of the staff quarters and boat dock so we didn’t really want to open our curtains. Additionally, I was expecting a work call in the evening and couldn’t take it from the room as the live performance was happening in the courtyard next to the bar (it might as well have been happening in our room, it was so loud).   Overall, I would say this property is a must if you visit Udaipur. We even watched Octopussy while trying to fall asleep one night, which only added to the experience. Sure, it could use a little updating here and there, and I do think they should ban functions unless the hosts book out the whole property, but you can’t come to Udaipur and not stay here!", "Taj Lake Palace is a dream holiday destination but while it is priced as a luxury property it is far from being one. The location of the hotel, in the middle of Lake Pichola, raises expectation as your boat sails towards it but Taj fails miserably to live up to that expectation. Barring the grumpy concierge at the reception, most of the folks are enthusiastic and makes effort to make your stay comfortable. The rooms are small and the furniture uncomfortable. The chairs in the room have no cushioning at all and the room lacks a mini bar… strangely because of the pandemic. It is difficult to comprehend why the naughty viruses will latch on to a bottle of beer but will spare the cup of tea. The restaurants are a big let down and they have two of them. Jharokha, the all day dinning", " restaurant needs to train its staff .. as we never found them offering a drinks menu as if saying “buddy just eat and scoot”. The taste of food was also very erratic. The prized local delicacy Lal Maas was too spicy and Poorie Bhaji’s sabji was too sour. The idly in breakfast was dry with a crust. The fine dinning restaurant, Neel Kamal, was an even bigger disappointment. Galawati Kabab which is supposed to melt in your mouth was of such firm texture that its melting beyond the mouth was also a struggle. All dishes tasted less than mediocre. I can safely say that they serve the worst Gulabjamun in whole of Rajasthan. The concierge desk was another poor performer. It failed to advise us that being a holiday season and we should start early morning for seeing the places of interest in Udaipur. We landed up amidst huge crowd in these COVID times and had to shorten our tour significantly after having paid for it. As I write I am still trying to get the invoice sent to me with the right name. Quite bizarre. To sum it up it’s a great property but way overpriced.", "Taj Lake Palace is Taj's 2nd oldest property and perhaps among the most beautiful ones. The ferry staff and the boatman greeted us warmly, the welcome with rose petals was a nice touch and check-in process was smooth. The property is extremely beautiful and the ambience both during the day is tranquil and in the evenings is cosy and soothing. The rooms are small in size and the bathroom is virtually claustrophobic. You could spend hours in the heated pool and jacuzzi or curl up in one of the lake facing couches with a book. We had 3 meals (excluding breakfast) during our 2 day stay and each one was better than the last. Neel kamal probably serves the best ker sangri and daal baati. But the breakfast is a huge letdown. I have read some great reviews but the taste and spread is", " mediocre and can be overshadowed by any 3 star restaurant. We had stayed in Jai Mahal Palace, Jaipur a few days earlier and that the spread as well as taste was several notches above. What rankled me was that the the breakfast on the 2nd day was a virtual repeat with absolutely no changes - same juices, same upma (some restaurants swap upma with sevaiya upma or even poha) and same poori bhaji.  Pros 1. Excellent property 2. Superb lunch and dinner 3. Appreciate the gesture of sending a small cake for my father who celebrated his 65th a few days earlier  Areas of improvement 1. Breakfast!!!! 2. Service levels. Khushi and Anil at Jharokha were helpful. Disappointing experience at both the bar and Neel kamal. The cocktail I ordered was tasteless to which the server replied \"This is how we make it. Probably its because the ice has melted.\" The replacement drink was even worse. At Neelkamal, the ghevar was dry and the reply was \"Every chef has a different preparation method.\" Inspite of pointing this out to Rahul and Navneet at the time of check out (the took the feedback in the right spirit), I was surprised that I was charged for the same - an extra Rs. 2000 doesn't bother me after spending a packet at TLP but leaves a bad taste in the mouth.  The last point notwithstanding, this is a unique and extremely beautiful property and should definitely be visited.", "This is probably one of the most difficult reviews that I have written. It has been an old dream of ours to stay at the Lake Palace, Udaipur.  We had seen reviews and watched videos of the place for many years and was really taken in by all the opulence and class of the property. However now that we actually stayed there, we have to say that we had overestimated what the experience would be like.    Now, I’m not saying that there was anything wrong with the place. As a matter of fact, the opulence and the attentiveness of the staff is top class and I have no complaints there. The problem is that the overall experience was not what I had expected from a property that charges over $ 500 a night. For example, the paper napkins in the restaurant, drinking water handed out in small", " plastic bottles, the crockery was of the same standard as I would find in a 3 star place in any small town in India. All this was really disappointing and not what I had expected from a property that claims to be one of the finest hotels in the world. I was expecting luxury of the top range but that is not what one can expect at the Lake Palace now.  If I had known that this was all I could expect I would have not stayed more than 1 night here and then moved over to a less pricy and modern property like the Trident, which I had visited and found to be very nice too.   But on the positive side the property itself is stunning, spotlessly clean, the rooms are very comfortable and classy, and the staff are all very friendly and efficient.  So, my advice would be definitely stay at the Lake Palace just to enjoy the property, but you don’t need to spend more than 1 night there.", "Taj Lake Palace is a palace conerted to hotel in the midst of Lake Pichola.

Fruit basket on arrival along with the welcome drink. 7. Welcoming at the hotel jetty with a showering of rose petal. ( We were behind a group, so no rose petals for us. It just stopped as the group passed by).  Cons:  1. Geared for catering to the foreigners. 2. High Bath Tub level, so senior persons may have difficulty to enter into the bath tub for a bath. 3. No sprinkler in the toilet, use only Toilet paper. 4. Jhankar restaurant, where you take your breakfast, is congested, waiters are not responsive and half", " the food items spread you can't see. 5.

Ask for a package as otherwise it becomes quite expensive esp for non vegetarians. I recommended to the mgmt to introduce a package for non vegetarians. Their packages include a 1.5-2 hr treatment and 3 vegetarian meals as it is designed more for people coming for 7-14 day Ayurveda treatments. Hence I recommended a package for veg/non veg leisure travellers. I was told about the veg package only after asking if there was something that could be worked out after seeing the massage rates. In fact I asked for the spa menu a few times before our trip but was told", " it was feasible only after arrival. Given the pandemic and travellers being more price conscious, hotels should be more budget friendly and given the monsoon season. Of course, Nattika mgmt did what they could at the end to reduce the charges wherever possible and I am very appreciative of that. 2. Interiors could definitely be more aesthetically designed considering the positioning of the resort. The bathrooms are however well done. 3. The massages are good, but my sons who play competitive sports and are used to regular massages, did not find them up to the mark, in the sense that they are relaxing but not for muscle release. 4. Needless to say face massages are banned currently so shirodhara is just oil poured on to the forehead for 25-30 mins.  The staff are wonderful.

WC was dirty. There is no room service. Even for a cup of tea, you have to climb down uncomfortable stairs. There is no phone in the room if you need any help.  TV facility is not functional.

There should be a variety of items available in breakfast  e.g. fruits (papaya, banana), bread/butter, omlette, poha, oats, parantha etc with tea/coffee, juice. This is the minimum one expects from a heritage lake palace hotel. Further, we faced a lot of discomfort while reaching the hotel as the approach road was all broken with huge pot holes. The staff at hotel didnt seem much concerned , being a sarkari employee. I regret having spent a huge amount of 4k+ with no comfort and facility to name. Will RTDC take note ?", "Siliserh is one of my favourite places to visit every year. With the imposing structure of the palace literally hanging from the cliff, the place invokes awe for first time visitors. The panoramic view of the lake with surrounding hills, its a must visit for every traveller.   The entrace fee to the property is100 bucks and is little too high but they provide you a free bottle of softdrink or water if u show the ticket stub. They do have a facility of boating on the lake which also seemed a bit over priced.   The hotel requires renovation in all fronts and needs to be more professionally managed.

Cool breeze from the lake is so very refreshing. Staff is courteous and helpful.   The suite is spacious and clean but one wall has dampness. General maintenance of the palace is not good. The lake palace urgently needs renovation.   RTDC should renovate the property to make it a memorable stay at the palace.", "We stayed in Suite Delux rooms (booked both available for a day). The best part is location. Staff is very humble and cooperative. We were scared about the cleanliness of the place after reading the reviews, but surprisingly rooms were very spacious and clean with a personal lake side facing balcony in one of the rooms. There were small spider webs on some wall sides, but they are hardly visible. Some sealen on one wall of a room is also there. But, it isn't much and doesn't bother at all. Some seepage on the lake side hotel is expected. The light went out for less than a minute 4-5 times which was a bit spooky, but fun. The generator backup is good and saves from any inconvenience.

I had some 10 lizards in my AC room which would just not go. In another room we found a snake. When we complained the staff said they were busy shoeing off a python at the hotel gate.  If you complain about insects and snakes, they will tell you are living in a jungle.

Staff through the day is more concerned about people visiting the lake for boating than guests at the hotel.  The hotel staff blame the government for not maintaining the hotel. Agreed. it's in a shambles. But what stops the staff from keeping it clean and pest free I do not understand. I had developed insect dermatitis by the time I reached home. Had to get treated.

I dont think it is allowed. Anyway. We found a lot of people coming and going to the temple but could not make it as it became dark and started to rain so we turned back.

There's plenty of easily accessible view points to enjoy the amazing sunset and sunrise.  The restaurant is located at the pool area, and dominates the seatings around the pool, which also host the main scenery.  The food is excellent though the main meals are buffets, they do offer al carte on request.   WhatI loved the second most (after the views) was the hospitality.

My room, Teeter Mahal, was superb. two single beds, hallway with seating, windows, facing the pool side, and huge bathroom.  The door is facing the inner court which host the afternoon high tea.

Near Temple St markets, near Mong Kok, near bus and trains   - Consider taking A21 bus to and from airport. It's only HKD33 one way.

I always appreciate free bottles of water.  Cons: -------   - It's really old. It just doesn't look inviting. Beds feel...flat. I've been to two 1 star hotels in HK in the last 7 months which have been renovated and look more inviting and newer than Booth. The 1 star places differ only is the size- they are just small.   - For just USD$10-15 more a night, the next door Caritas has renovated rooms and free breakfast. Downside- Caritas does not have free newspapers. Not sure about the bottled water.  So would I stay there again? Probably not, unless it was a matter of money or I couldnt find another place (I often book within a few days of my trips, so it's a possibility)  I know I'm wordy, so thanks for your patience!

Rohit at the reception became like our tour guide for local.site seeing which had we missed, we would have missed many ecological.wonders of this region. Be it guiding us for sites, or for pure veg eateries and restaurants in and around our visit areas, Rohit was apt, prompt and proactive!  Sanjoy the house keeping staff was as polite as his seniors.   The staff at the property's restaurant was as warm and hospitable as a high star rated property. Ramesh's smiling welcome smiling face while serving food soothed our tiredness after the day-long site seeing was refreshing. Jiten, Rocky, Jeleen were as prompt at the backend. Chef Samarjeet treated us with fresh, home style food for all the 5 meals that we took in 2 days. for our last dinner, Samarjeet ltreated is with a spread of local veg dishes.   We had booked 3 cottages for 3 nights and 2 days. Excellent cottages by design and also by comfort. Very spacious and beautiful contemporary design with all the contemporary amenities. Each cottage can accomodate 5 people very comfortably. Ideal for friends gathering. We had stayed with friends and family.   Over all, a warm and soothing experience!  A must stay property in Imphal.  Around 40 km away from the city, but right in the heart of the Loktak lake, 20 min away from the Keibul Lamjao National park- World's only floating national park.   ", "Stayed for 2 nights in one of the cottages with great views over the Loktak lake. Bathroom was too cramped and ill designed. On site restaurant has very limited food choices, which are only partially compensated by the great views.", "The location is great but rooms are mediocre and have a huge scope to be done better.  Restaurant is average with limited menu. Local food can be introduced, as in Imphal. Souvenir and local handicrafts stalls can be introduced ", "A great place to stay in Loktak lake. The rooms are big and very clean. Friendly staff. The views from the resort was amazing.   The restaurant had little options as many items in the menu were not available.", "It's an excellent stay. Rooms were nice and u can view Loktak lake from the balconies. Service is also very good. Food was also good. Rooms were clean. The whole property is well maintained. We enjoyed every bit of it.", "It took me couple of days to realize & understand the importance of this property . Its not only a well etched out  property on a hilltop  but also a local hangout destination. This place has a major govt. push and that describes its location & proximity to the lake .  The lake in itself is a major tourist destination, but one can have a 360 degree as well as birds eye view of the lake from this resort . The expanse of the resort can be gaged from the fact that you can have multiple  points for you to soak in  beautiful views of Sun rise & especially sun set .  There is a restaurant on the other side of the property and the team here does a fairly good job in terms of the taste & service . However no order will be taken after 7 pm but the food can be served late, into the room. ", " There is a watch tower kind of structure on the other end of the property which I believe only is for having the views of the loktak lake . When we happened to be here then one evening we encountered very strong winds and standing still at this elevated spot became a task in itself . The staff here was uber friendly and is very well maintained, the design of adjoining galleries is very aesthetically done . If you happen to opt for the cottages , then please factor in the location which is in slight seclusion and 70-100 mts from the reception. The cottages themselves are also done in very fine taste and includes a kitchen and are double storied.  Please make it a point to carry mosquito repellant cream & few books to read from the gallery of the room ( if you are a book reader ).  Other thing to figure in while planning your prospective trip to Sendra is that it is 30 kms away from main Imphal city, however the resort is beautiful one :)", "Definitely Sendra Park & resort on Loktak Lake-Manipur will always remain special to me as I have stayed here with my friends and family for my marriage. We stayed around one week for 15 people and enjoyed the place like anything!  Its purely nature lovers paradise but includes the activities like tracking or walking as it is on hiltop just aside on Loktak lake. One can take a leisure boat ride on Loktak Lake just within two minutes from the resort.The resort has 4 cottages with very modern facilities. Each of them is of mini duplex of European style. The ground floor have one double bedded room well equipped with LED TV, high quality linen  attached clean bathroom-24 hrs hot water supply along with optional sink basin for occasional cooking. The upper deck has place for extra", " two beds and place for evening tea...All the cottages are on private part of the resort looking the Lake lake without any hindrance.  The resort has 4-5 dubble bedded AC rooms with attached balcony. The space is never been problem of this resort so the rooms can be compared with mini suites in other cities. The resort has one highly appreciable hill top view point resto which is phenomenal for view and foods. The menu is not that elaborated but definitely tasty. We have all our buffets lunch and dinner here and specially the home cooked chicken with lots of herbs is wonderful. The service and respect to its client is perfect. The place is very secure and request all future visitor not to listen any bogus comments. Its next to Indian Army cantonment and nearby places are very peaceful. Its approx 30 kms from Imphal Airport. The tata magic or buses runs from the moirang bazar to resort. The airport taxi will charge 800 Indian rupees for dropping......overall it was perhaps one of the best week in my life till date off-course for my marriage but also for this resort to make it icing on this programme. Strongly recommended to have purely natural life on lake while not compromising on facilities......"], "rating": "4.5"},

{"place": "The Sariska Palace", "reviews": ["I had been fascinated by this property ever since I came to Sariska for the first time, may be 35 years back... well until I stayed here for the first time this year. This property has couple of advantages- word 'palace' attached to it which makes it a bit more charming, and secondly, its proximity to the Sariska Gate of the Tiger Reserve- a benefit it shares with only one other property- RTDC's Tiger Den. For a safari trip to a national park or a reserve, I will always prefer a place of stay, which is closest to the entry gate, as it gives more time in the morning to prepare for the safaris.  Sariska palace was a much admired place some years down the lane, but then perhaps it lost the momentum for whatever reason and now it is trying to get up again.  This property is huge,", " more than what any top notch property will expect to have. It was an erstwhile palace and thus it classifies for a heritage property but what disappoints is its upkeep. It has got all the infrastructure, space and just needs a approach. Staff is good, courteous but needs a more professional exposure. Food department also needs a bit up gradation. They need to understand that it is Rajasthan which takes pride in its cuisine as well as hospitality. Sariska Palace lacks in that standard as of now. Still, property is worth trying once to feel a bygone era. I might still give it another go owing to its advantages and will keep hoping that it improves itself, because it deserves that.", "It was a total regret having chosen the Sariska Palace for stay. Staff was not bothered. Maintenance of property was pathetic. Cleanliness was zero as they were understaffed. A very wrong decision to stay at this property.  The food served seemed to be stale and served shabbily", "Bad points: 1)We arrived hoping to stay in the main palace, not realising there are a few annex buildings in the grounds. After being shown about 2 rooms in these buildings (some a short trek), we finally persuaded the staff that we wanted to stay in the main building and were given probably the nicest room in the place.  It really felt as though we were being taken for a bit of a ride and had we not put our foot down we would have been given a room that we weren't happy with.  2)No-one showed us where anything was such as the restaurant, bar, swimming pool etc.... there is no information about the services or the history of the palace and the local area - for somewhere that is a historical building I would expect information at least in reception if not in each room.  There is", " also no written information (that I could find anyway) about the jeep safaris, what time they run, what animals you may see etc.. The only information I saw was a board in reception that gave a few basic details.  3)we asked to play tennis, this took one of the staff some time to find a tennis ball so we were hanging around.  4)there is one phone to dial to the UK which is at main reception so it is impossible to have a private conversation.  When we were there the line was down so couldn't make a call at all.  5)we wanted to get a cab to Jaipur only to be quoted a really extortionate sum, we were told that the cab had to come from Jaipur to collect us and drive us back there, which was apparently why it was so expensive. However, we found out that there was a taxi service which was just outside the hotel and a much cheaper option.  Luckily we went for the cheaper option.  In all, we felt there is a high amount of disorganisation at management level, which could so easily be rectified.  It was the most disorganised hotel (and the most expensive) we stayed in during our visit to India.  The reception staff were quite unhelpful as well.    Good Points 1) fabulous pool 2) fabulous room - if you demand one 3) quite good food 4) lovely views and surroundings 5) fantastic duvets ! 6) The waiters and housekeeping were great.  7) nice bar with good music ", "I checked in on 14 october 2021.

There was little hitch at room allotment but this was taken care well by mr Rathore and other managerial staff Other creative amenities are also provided  for no extra charges Overall a night out with friends and family  was worth spending", "I visited the Lohagarh resort in mid May. It's one of the finest resorts in the vicinity of Jaipur. Just 20 kms from city center which takes around 30-45 minutes to reach just off the Delhi Highway. This place has wonderful rooms and the property itself has so many different activities to offer. The swimming pool is one of the highlights as it is completely surrounded by trees. You can find banyan trees and peepal within the property which are humongous. The nature is beautiful. The one thing which I love the most about it is the nature, the way they have maintained the nature within the property is commendable. There you can walk or take safari to the flower valley which is located west of the property just 500 metres, it has beautiful flower fields where you can relax and have", " a refreshing drink to cool off the summer heat.  The room itself in which I stayed is comfortable and beautiful, with lots of privacy and peace to offer. Though the property is also a heritage wedding destination which in itself is amazing (if you want to get married - this is the place😅). Food is delicious. Services are prompt.  Mr. Santosh the manager is very kind, supportive and attentive to the needs of the customers.  Aman at the restaurant was very keen and joyful to serve you the delicacies of the place. 5 out of 5 for me.  Will visit again, for sure", "This may appear at first as a resort that is not distinctive but do not be fooled by what you hear or read. Till you do not visit you will not appreciate the effort put in by the owner to make a mundane holiday very interesting. The site is large tucked away within a hill setting and it gradually dawns upon you that there is so much to do, the villa rooms are unique and full of character, the meals are tastefully prepared and served in truly Rajasthani style and service is fabulous. The staff are all good people. Above all it is a great wedding destination hotel and it will give competing five star hotels nearby a good run for their money. Try it experience it and enjoy this property."], "rating": "4.5"},

Try the hot garlic cheese balls, Any Paneer dish, Hot Shorba and the Peshavari Naan here.   I can not say the rates are cheap. But you must visit this place atleast once With your family. It can serve as a nice little picnic spot. Also, the cleanliness of the place can be improved.

There is nothing extra ordinary about this fort. Its a normal building that is being maintained in a pretty ordinary way. Anyways we were not there tostay. Let me come to the point for which we were there.....the food.... frankly speaking we never expected food to be that good at the price they have given. I would not say it was out of the worls but given the price quoted it was great. They served us the buffet with snacks and evening tea. Service was bit slow but food was served hot and fresh. Special mention of paneer tikka it was very nice. The staff was quite friendly too!!!!!", "I stayed here with Family and kids, room phone and tv was not working, no cleanliness, every time we have to go down for any service request as phone was not working. they started restaurant around 8 than only we get milk for kid though i was requesting since 5.30 AM, that too kettle was very -very dirty,  we had lunch and dinner at their restaurant, there was almost no service we have to wait long for any ordered food, that too they were serving as per their convenience. soup after starter, vegetable first without chapati and soo on, very very worst experience, there was very foul smell in every room, like selling", "Not a good experience.  Very poor food quality . Snacks were fine , but main course was really bad.  Service was not up to mark . Service was quite slow . Your tomato soup used to be famous , but this time it was not good .", "We checked in at The Fort Ramgarh on 17th August morning at 2 AM while coming back from Kufri. We had taken two Royal Suites. The AC leaked continuously in one of the rooms and the water soaked the bed sheets. In the second room, the AC stopped functioning after half an hour. We were there for 2 nights, so we changed our rooms to Imperial Suites. However, the story remained the same and the ACs stopped working after periodically after some time.   Another strange practice was that the complete amount was taken in advance for each and every item. I ordered 1 bottle of water in the morning, and the waiter asked for INR 47 to be paid in advance for the bottle. After an hour, I again ordered for water and tea and the waiter again asked the payment in advance. It felt as if we were", " staying in a lodge rather than in a Heritage property.   The rooms and washroom were very dirty and stinky. The washroom next to the restaurant smelled like a Bus Depot common toilet. The corridors, stairways, common areas were unkempt and really shabby.  The staff was untrained to handle any calls or calls for service. The food was really lousy.  The property otherwise is good but the maintenance and service standards are too low. It does not give you a feeling that you are staying in a Heritage property.", "A place which has no respect for customers, first time visitors. The Front desk staff and the Managers don't have etiquette of how should they speak to a customer of opposite sex. No courtesy at all of any kind and moreover not ready to accept their fault and blame customers.  I went on the 14th June'15 evenings and spoke to one of the managers about the place and asked if it is fine to come with some friends and use their garden for taking some photos, which he agreed.  Now, I went their with my friend on the 15th ( the next day ) and spoke to the Front Desk Lady who had no information about the same. She was nice to speak to and called the manager on duty at that time Mr Mahesh Sharma.  Now this person was totally Rude to us right from the start, and started speaking to us", " badly. He said, we have to pay 15000 for 1.5 hrs else we have to leave the premises right now. He had no decency to speak to customers and was very abrupt and used foul language.  I said, we have had a word with another Manager who I met day before Mr Ashish, who was very polite and courteous to me. Mr sharma totally denied that he didn't approve anything and is on Leave.  However, when I reached the place initially, I got told that he is at another location and will be coming back later.  Now, this was something which was not acceptable as one person says he is on leave and another says he is at the other location. Who should be believe on was the question.  The Lady who we spoke to initially said, this is a mistake from our end, that Mr Ashish approved your request and asked us to wait till she gets a response from him and clarifies a few things.  While all of this was happening, there was another Front Office Staff, Mr Tarun Kaushal at the reception. He was another nightmare to speak to, had to respect towards us, no decency at all. Started telling us that this place has RIGHTS OF ADMISSION RESERVED. I asked where is that written, please give us the Terms and Conditions of the HOTEL, and any document which specifically states that The Hotel charges so and so amount for any kind of photos being taken.   None of the Hotel staff was able to give us any such things, and said this is upto Us, what we charge and how to we charge. We will give you a receipt and that is all what We will get as a proof.  Well, the Question is If the Hotel has any such facility, it should be specifically mentioned and documented somewhere on the Hotel Brochures and also on should be available with the Reception Staff at all times. He kept on insisting that we don't have any terms and conditions document of any sort and We are no one to ask that from them as this is a Pvt owned property.  Mr Tarun was so rude to the female friend who was with me that she almost cried and was very sad about this behaviour. I added that I will report this to Trip Advisor, as their was a Recommended by Trip Advisor sticker on their Reception. He added, \" DO WHAT YOU CAN, I DON'T CARE. TAKE MY PHONE NUMBER ALSO, I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY or WHAT YOU DO\".  When, a HOTEL staff can be so blunt, that they don't even care and respect what customers have to tell about the services they are giving, how can you expect to have new customer coming down to your place as guests. I wonder, what kind of treatment would they be getting.  Another thing that was very bad, I used the Men's Restroom and it was stinking, there was water Leakage all over the floor, which I informed the Front office staff, they replied \" YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL US WHAT IS WRONG AT THIS PLACE, WE KNOW HOW TO TAKE CARE OF THIS PLACE\".  Can anyone imagine being told this when you are giving constructive feedback to them about something which is at fault.  All of this kept on going for about 2 hrs, and we waited to speak to the MD of the HOTEL, which we were not being able to as the STAFF kept on telling us to GO AWAY. I said, let me speak to the MD over the phone, they didn't let us do that too.  Why on earth would someone do that, knowing that They are at Fault and We wanted to report all this that has happened to us and how have we been treated by the HOTEL STAFF.  Finally Mr Mahesh Sharma came back and again started speaking to both of us very rudely, saying GET OUT OF THIS PLACE, IT is MY PROPERTY and I CAN DO ANYTHING I WANT. I asked him politely to have some decency on how he is speaking to me and my female friend, he said DO WHAT YOU WANT, JUST GET OUT.  While we were on our way out, we saw a few other people inside the premises using cameras to take pictures and were not being said anything. WHY WAS SUCH A BEHAVIOUR TOWARDS US?  Who on earth would say this to their First time visitors, especially being from the Hospitality industry which works on Reviews and word of mouth, the service being provided.   I seriously would never Recommend such a place to any of the Visitors.", "This is not a fort. this is cage. when we enter in rooms we feel that its a cage even heater is not working in the witner november 11.Above this the food quality is also very poor.They dont know how to cook toast bread butte.You have to wait outside the gate for 10 minutes for somebody whocome and take  your luggages.

The queens room on first and second floor are spacious but with very limited view of the lake. The jewel is the King's room with a large sitout overlooking the lake pichola and absolutely worth the higher premium it demands. The hotel doesn't have a lift or a restaurant of its own but breakfast is served at the top floor sit out by the caretaker Jaswant aka Jassu who was very helpful and friendly. Hotel is located just a five minutes walk to the three main attractions of Udaipur, the lake palace, Jagdish palace and Bagore ki haveli which hos a folk dance dance show every evening.  The only downside was the 1000 am check out policy.. Overall a great stay !", "What first prompted me to book our two rooms at Raj Niwas for my family of five was the decor of the rooms depicted in the pictures & the great reviews. Raj Niwas was the perfect place for our 4 nights in Udaipur for many reasons but the most important one is the quality attention and care that we received from the resident caretaker Jassu. Jassu was there for our every need from arranging horseback riding, dinner reservations, a tuk tuk tour of the city, directions  and transportation. He kept our rooms immaculately clean and stocked with amenities as well as prepared delicious breakfast every morning on the roof top deck. He literally made our time in Udaipur a special one.   Raj Niwas is a small boutique hotel with 3 rooms, each large & colorfully decorated with huge windows.", " We stayed in the two queen rooms & the beds were massive! The 3 rooms are stacked on top of one another & connected by a staircase. The King Suite is the top room with its own private balcony looking out onto the lake. If the King Suite is available, I suggest booking it because of the private balcony. However, we were more than pleased with our two queen rooms. The rooms are really light & inviting when the curtains are open.   The location of Raj Niwas is great! You can walk to the City Palace, the Jagat Hindu Temple, the traditional dance show & boat rides on the lake.   I highly recommend staying at the Raj Niwas. You will not be disappointed with the wonderful care Jassu provides & your accommodations. ", "Jassu who runs this lovely haveli single handedly made our stay. Not only is the haveli exceptionally well located next to all the sites, but the room (we stayed on top room with the balcony) was gorgeous. Jassu gave great advice and found us a reliable and honest driver to Jodhpur. He made sure we were well taken care  of during our stay  (i.e. when we ate across the street he made sure the waiters gave us great service, reliable tuk-tuk drivers). I highly recommend to stay here. The owner of the haveli is very lucky to have such a positive, joyful and honest manager who does everything to accommodate his guests.", "We had 3 nights in the King Suite 18-21st Feb. It was great!! The amazing balcony overlooking the lake is a lovely place to relax - we especially enjoyed it in the early morning when there was a sense of quiet and calm and again in the late afternoon for sunset! The room itself is huge with lots of seating space. Jassu is an absolute star, he takes great care of you the whole time - he gave us breakfast when we arrived early from our overnight train, provided really good local tips and advise and always a friendly smiling face! We would have loved to have stayed a few more nights but the hotel was fully booked. Would 100% stay here on another visit to Udaipur, no where else would live up to it! Highly recommend to all.", "Pros: 1. Location. 5 min walking distance to City Palace. So you save lot of money on local commute (which is very costly) 2. Safe locality due to foriegn customers 3. All other hotels like Aashiyan Haveli, jaiwana Haveli, etc are side by side. 4. Walking distance from Gateway restaurant which is huge plus point according to me. (When you plan itinerary or visit udaipur you may realize importance of this Hotel). Also next building is Jaiwana Haveli and hence you can enjoy roof top restaurant of Jaiwana Haveli. Food is good but a bit expensive here. 5. Superb Clean Hotel 6. One man Army. Jassu. he manages Hotel right from cleaning, serving breakfast, and everything. Very nice guy. Helpful Polite. He also gives information about what he knows but do not just rely on one info, For", " e.g. He said Udaipur ropeway will be crowded, but when we went there hardly 10 people were in queue and we took couple tickets so we were allowed to stand directly first in queue. Some kind of priviledge to buy couple tickets.  7. Roof top restaurant. nice view of lake pichola and taj lake palace from restaurant. 8. Waiting room is also nice big and comfotable. We arrived in plane from mumbai so reached hotel at around 8 AM. Checkin time was 12 PM. So we kept our lugguage there rested for half an hour and went to City palace walking. Had lunch in Gateway restaurant and checkdin to Hotel. So time was also utilized.  Cons: 1. I feel a bit pricy 2. Restaurant serves only breakfast. Bread toast butter jam always available. Other options are Poha and Paratha which should be oredered an hour before breakfast. Although Poha and paratha are tasty enough. 3. Only 3 rooms. Even though hotel says lake view property but only Maharaja Suite is lake view. 2 Maharani suite is not lake view. 4. Other hotels in area like Jaiwana haveli and aashiya haveli can provide rooms at lower cost. but rooms in Raj Niwas are big, spacious, authentic decor and clean. Although other hotels are also clean as i went just to check their rooms but are small.  Some tips (Hotel and Udaipur): 1. Book Maharaj Suite if you want lake view from room 2. Do not book or hire any auto rickshaw right outside your hotel they will charge more. just walk for 5 minutes out of that area and then search auto rickshaw you will be able to bargain. 3. Gateway Hotel, Govinda's Cafeteria, Jaiwana Haveli roof top (Dinner) and Natraj Dining hall are good places to eat in udaipur. 4. Plan your spots for sight seeing, activites and dinner/ lunch strategically to travel less and save more. 5. Saheliyon ki bari is over-rated. Its simple garden and couple of normal fountains nothaing special. 6. Vintage car museum is too costly. 250/- per head just to see 10 vintage cars nothing else. That too inside one room you cant even touch them. Unless you are passionate about vintage cars not worth spending 500/- for a couple.  My Itenerary was inshort: Day 1: morning City palace, lunch in Gateway restaurant. back to Hotel and rest Evening (around 4 move out of hotel) went go to Udaipur ropeway, Fateh sagar lake (Speed boating) during sunset then saheliyon ki Bari. Have dinner at Natraj Dinning hall/ or Jaiwana Haveli roof top. Next day morning Jadish Temple (walkable distance from Raj Niwas), Boating at Lake pichola including Jag Mandir island. Lunch at gateway restaurant. Evening go to Vintage car museum and do shopping  Shopping: There is shop in front of vintage car museum Some shilpgram trust for sarees (Lehriya and Bandhani).. A Bit costly not much but superb variety. You wont find such collection anywhere else in udaipur. You can get regulr price Sarees in hathi pol as well. Shop jootis from Hatthi pol or few shops near City palace gate Some traditional antique stuff from Rajasthali, a government shop. There is good shop inside City Palace gate. It is resonable and has good stuff.", "The good news first...the location of the hotel is brilliant and specially if you are stying at the third floor which has a balcony then you will get the vantage point of the Lake Palace hotel, Lake Pichola and the tiny hills behind the lake. If you are fond of Silver Jewellery then the shop below the hotel will mesmerise you with their designs. The CareTaker Jassu who looks and behaves like a Joker with a good heart will regale you with stories. The rooms and washroom will be clean.   The Bad News...you will feel completely cheated due to the lack of amenities and services.

If you are really tired and do not feel like facing the stairs (yes, the hotel does not have a lift) then you will need to survive on the breeze blowing from Lake Pichola since nothing can be ordered from outside. So think before you book the hotel and better still book it if you get it at a reasonable price. Paying Rs 11000/- for a two night stay definitely made me feel dissatisfied.", "First thing is first... It is not a hotel ... it is a guest house. It is a three room property with the Maharaja Suite, Maharani Suite and a Luxury Suite. The property is managed by only one guy Jassu/Jaswant. The guy has a habit of stepping on your feet with his rules and regulations. So while we stayed in the Maharaji Suite with a balcony and view of the lake, Jassu's rules did not permit even tea/coffee on the balcony. There is no room service. Even the breakfast in the morning (included in the package) is a sordid affair of choices of eggs or plain cornflakes. It was only after we insisted that we are vegetarians that Jassu did us a 'favor' and arranged paranthas from a nearby hotel.   He has a self confessed preference for foreigners only, which he mentioned the first", " moment we stepped into the room. He also informed us that the rooms were last painted 7 years ago and that guests should ensure that everything remains clean and tidy.  We paid Rs.4600/night (taxes included) for this place which a GRAND rip off that Agoda.com has played on us. Agoda people it seems have never visited this GUESTHOUSE and continue to list it as a hotel. There are some reviews I have read that mention that the hotel has a good view of lake pichola... well my dear friends there are hundreds of hotels in Udaipur that have a great view of Pichola, so it is nothing unique. If you really want a good view of pichola, try Ras Leela which is bang on the Pichola lake or try Jagat Niwas or Lake Pichola hotel itself.These are actual hotels and not a guest house like Raj Niwas.  Avoid this place.", "Last week we arrived at the Raj Niwas hotel with confirmation of our booking through Agoda. When we arrived, after carrying our bags over 100 meters from the taxi, we were told that Agoda made a mistake booking the reservation and they would instead send us to a sister hotel, outside of the center, with a much lower ranking. They said it was 5 minutes away but in reality it was 4 km away. We had to pay for the taxi to get there and waste a couple of hours of valuable vacation time on the ordeal. We were stuck in their sister hotel, Raj Kuber, well outside the center. This was the first disappointment.   The second one was when we asked the front desk for the cost of a taxi to Pushkar and we were quoted 50 percent above what the normal price should be. Needless to say, I arranged", " a taxi from a different company. An hour before our taxi was to come, the person at the front desk told me to call the taxi and lie to them and say we decided to spend an extra night, and she'll beat our lower price by 500 rupees. I explained that I don't tell lies like this. But it shows well the character of the hotel chain if they tell their guests to lie to other service providers. Stay away from the Raj chain in Udaipur!", "The maharaja suite In this hotel was booked a month ago for two days. When we reached to the location we found that the room is actually given to some one else. We were informed that the travel website we booked through overbooked the room to two different customers for one of the day of two we were going to spend there. We found that that actually did happen. But what hotel also did from their side is that they decided to give the booked room to someone else for second day of the two days we were there. Which means that we paid for the maharaja suite refundable ( refunded costed us more!) and ended up staying in a lower grade room that initially booked even after booking a month in advance and getting a ' refundable ' room.  This was peak season so what I am afraid they ( agoda", " and the hotel) did I'd that sold the room to some one else for higher price and left us stranded. Very very untrustworthy and unprofessional service from the hotel for some extra bucks. Careful if you have booked your rooms here for peak season.", "Enough has been said in d reviews below about the hotel and I agree to the most of it.   Best things about this place are: 1. View of the lake pichola 2. Next to the ghat 'easy to get boats and other conveyance 3. All good restaurants, shopping places and heritage sites are at walking distance.  4. If you get Maharaja suite you can enjoy the balcony and it's view.  Things that you might not like about the place : 1. No lift - disabled persons can face issues. Rest its just 3 floors and one more floor for roof top kitchen.  2. No restaurant - there's no facility for lunch n dinner and breakfast is limited with toast omelette tea and local snacks. No alcohol as well.  3. With the cost of rooms water and additional tea has an extra cost.  All in all its one of the only places which", " will offer u a balcony. So its a worth staying place.  If you'll converse with Jassu -the caretaker,about the place and why it is like this. You will understand it is best the way it is. However water n tea can be added to the package.  Also ask Jassu for assistance for local travel, and if you can get Shersingh  the auto guy, he will help you very well with the sightseeing and shopping. The emporium he takes you to, is the most reasonable place.  Loved our stay Mr. JHALA and Jassu. Hope to be here again.   "], "rating": "4.5"},

Village is beautifully maintained and people there are extremely courteous, if you strike a conversation you would know the effort they are making for their living specially in Covid. We spent most of our evenings in the village and had a brilliant time.  Now coming to the resort, honestly disappointed with the overall experience leaving aside the polite reception staff.

Building experience - No mark down here in my rating but sure this could have influence for an extra star. I mentioned during my booking on their website, mentioned at the time or check-in also about the occasion we have come however forget about adding some basic decor or a cookie as gesture, looks like no one was reading it and wishing also. If I compare this with my experience at West Inn Sohna road it was mind blowing for sure so they shall at least start reading what customer is writing.  4. Room service was good, no complaints overall and were reasonably quick in delivering given the short staff due to Covid. Delays mostly were due to staff issues so not blowing this off understanding the situation.  5. Village - This is the high point and every minute spent there is worth it, crowd management in Covid was tough but management was doing everything possible to keep reiterating. Multiple options, good setup, music and shows makes it a perfect place to visit. ", "I booked 2 cottages. The rooms were clean, the staff were courteous. I had a bad taste of the arrangements during breakfast. The breakfast area could hardly accommodate 25% of the people stay at this place, resulting in long wait times. In my case about 35 minutes. Even after that I left the place without having the breakfast. For such pricey place like this, I’d expect a top notch arrangements. My personal experience is nothing but bad.  I would not go back to this place.", "We stayed here for a night in Feb,21 and it was an extremely disappointing experience! Firstly, only 4 rooms were booked in the entire Resort and it looked like they cleaned the Resort before Covid. It was dirty! Unwelcoming and bad attitude from staff made the stay worse. Mosquitoes were all around the Resort and first thing they offered in the Room was a ‘Mosquito repellent’. Linen quality was bad and fridge was not working(which got replaced around 9 PM) Breakfast was even more disappointing with very limited options and stale muffins and cakes.  Overall a big No to whosoever is planning to visit this resort!", "We called up the resort to ask whether a lunch would be possible as opposed to the famous evening dining experience. To which they replied yes as they have ala carte from 12-3PM. Which was perfect as we were a group of people who'd have different appetites and pallettes and could order little/lot depending on the situation. We drove 3 hours to get to the resort only to be shut off literally at the parking lot stating you have to shell out a ₹1500 cover charge per person. This wasn't stated on the phone call and when we requested to the lady at door to call the manager, she was just informed to let us off if we weren't keen on paying the cover charge.

No alternate arrangements for open air dining space in case of rain.  2. no COVID protocols were followed (no mask, no sanitiser no social distancing)  3. In case of rain there was no arrangement of umberallas to assist inhouse guests despite requests.

Shabby arrangement for buffet dinner was made in a indoor space and everyone was forced to eat the buffet despite the fact that property hosts a a la carte restaurant too.  5. Buffet dinner of 1600 per person, especially indoors in that clumsy space was so over priced. My family was asked to move to buffet hall from the a la carte restaurant...again in the rain.  6. Understand that nobody can control weather situations but we can certainly be prepared to handle it.  And why should only guests bear the brunt of it...if resort could not give services as per expected standards they should offer some discounts in such situations.  7. On raising this to front desk no action was taken and rather was made to wait for about 30 mins before saying a no.  8. A lady at the front desk (not naming her purposefully) passed on a cheesy comment on me which she thought might douse the situation. Had a similar comment might have been made by a male guest to a female employee of a resort it would have surely come in the bracket of indecency.  Suggestion to the managers their is that they should be better prepared to handle exceptional situations and they should provide more empowerment to their front desk.", "Guys don’t waste time going to this place.

Charges for adults and kids are same. As per the restaurant rules ,all kids of height above 3 and 1/2 are considered as adults @1000/-.And dinner is self service.So every one is rushing to counters to collect food for self then for kids.

Its only when we reached there after a 6 hours journey from Kokrajhar and checked into the resort that we were told that they could not book a safari for us. We could not go inside the sanctuary at all and felt cheated. Just for earning and getting tourist inflow, the owner should not lie to tourists. On top of that, some families with young kids that we met had been allowed inside. this clearly shows", " something underhand is going on.  Also, when we asked the manager about it, he was very rude even though it was him who had lied to us.", "Owner Nripen Nath is very close to me. He always is very supportive and ready to help tourists. He himself is a wildlife photographer. That is why can guide wildlife photographers visiting the Pobitora wildlife sanctuary.

Currently they have three cottages and three rooms and a dormitory. The cottages are spacious with hot water, electricity and TV with Cable connection, A playground for Kids, good Restaurant with quality food and service with reasonable price.

The room we stayed in was as expected, basic and simple but also clean and hygienic. During my one night stay there were frequent power cuts through the day but that wasn't so much of an issue. But then, we went without electricity for a good 2 & half hours in the night despite the hotel having a power generator. The restaurant is right across the hotel premises and serves freshly prepared authentic Assamese meals and we liked it very much. The owner of the place Mr. Nipen Nath, a friendly person, was available at all times and has maintained the place pretty hospitable. I would recommend staying at this resort.", "Established in 2012, this resort has made a good hold among the tourist came to Mayong and Pobitora. They offer a quality service to their guest with a budget price. It is located on the way to Pobitora Range Office. One can easily trace their place as it is in a roadside location. To get a memorable trip, I recommend this Resort. For their quality service, they always get positive feedback from their guest.

{"place": "Taj Theog Resort & Spa", "reviews": ["We have always looked forward to taking our holidays at Taj. For this stay at Taj Theog (Oct’22), I will mainly speak about Mr. Bhandari, who for us, embodied the true spirit of Taj. His official role is that to lead the FnB team. But he went over and beyond to ensure that we felt right at home. Even while we were enroute to the property he started calling us, giving us valuable inputs to avoid road traffic jams, understanding our food preferences and giving us the assurance that the entire Taj team was eagerly waiting to welcome us. We felt as if we were visiting our extended family. He was constantly connected with us during our 6-day stay, promptly attending to all our questions, requests, etc. He made us feel that we were the only guests at the resort. Soon we realized that", " he was paying the same level of attention to all the other guests as well.  His warmth, attention to detail, concern, etc. reflects his natural command on the hospitality business that comes only through several years of service and experience in developing a deep understanding of basic human needs to be heard and to be taken care of. I would encourage all the members of team Taj (not just at Theog), at all levels of management, to observe him and interact with him so the true spirit of Taj rubs off of everybody.   Location – Theog town is away from the hustle and bustle of the main Shimla city, making it an ideal holiday destination for those seeking peace and tranquility. We had an excellent bird’s eye view of the valley, the city and the nearby mountain ranges. Full marks for choosing the location.  Property - the infra is well kept, could definitely be better. I think the management realizes this since some of the rooms in the main building were being renovated during our stay. What also made our stay great for us was the complimentary upgrade to the Luxury Duplex Room. We (2 adults + 1 11 yr old) had originally booked a Luxury Room. However, we were informed that we could not get an extra bed in this room category, which was a huge surprise (short of a shock) since we had paid for 3 individuals. I had to make several calls but the property management acknowledged the problem and offered an upgrade to a room that allowed each of us to have comfortable sleeping space. I think this is something that the management should look into (maybe build extra storage space for extra beds, close to the villas and luxury rooms) since an upgrade may not be feasible during peak seasons.  Overall – We had a wonderful down time at Taj Theog. And it was interacting with Mr. Bhandari that made us realize that a Managing Director, CEO, General Manager’s, etc. are just job titles. Taj will be nothing without the real on-ground team playing their vital role, 24x7, being the flag bearers of the spirit of Taj. Imagine the growth possibilities for Taj, if every employee conducted him/herself like Mr. Bhandari!", "More than property, this review is about staff who have gone miles to make our stay most memorable. We stayed during the last weekend of May 2022 with 2 children  We booked Premium Room Valley View but upgraded to 502 - Kullu Suite (Duplex Suite Valley view) and we were mesmerized by this suite. All 4 days were just amazement.   The staff is very friendly and helpful. They are very accommodating to our needs. I've got so many compliments on the staff and their services. You guys deserve so much appreciation for the efforts you put in.  Kunjan: Thank you for your warmth & generosity. She is very kind, caring, and big-hearted. She was delightful in making our stay a memorable one. I would like to emphasize that she was the star of our stay.  Kaifee: Humble & polite. It was very", " courteous. Helped me book Taj Chandigarh. I thoroughly enjoyed our small talks.  Krish:  Clearly, I sense the affection of Mumbaikar. He was very energetic & pure devoted to every request,    Bhandariji: Most attentive of all. His suggestions were mount watering. I actually missed it when he wasn't there.   Raju: Down to earth & amazing. He & his team did a marvelous job of cleaning our mess every day. Very fast in bringing whatever we needed  In-room dining: No matter what time, whenever we ordered anything, they were able to deliver. They were very penchant, providing all Dal khichdi & porridge to my toddler.  About the property: It's huge & very picturesque. Unfortunately, images that are uploaded don't do justice to the beauty of the property. It's about 1 hour from main Shimla & at least 6 hours from Chandigarh airport. It has fantastic views of mountains & valleys. Has a good kid's play area but needs to add more toys. There is a swimming pool & jacuzzi as well. Overall nice property for families who has less interest in Mall road of Shimla  I would like to thank everyone who has taken such good care. Definitely coming back to experience the same level of hospitality.  Good luck team", "Recently visited Taj Theog with my family of 4, including teen aged kids.  We had a fantastic experience!  Starting with the Villa, which had amazing amenities and a gorgeous balcony view into the valley.    The food was great but it was mostly the Taj service that is exceptional.  From the minute we entered the hotel to our trip back, we were treated like royalties.    My son has sever food allergies and the resort made their chef available to us to discuss our options.  This happened every time we ate!  The kitchen staff was very diligent to make sure nothing got contaminated.  Very thankful for the care they took.  The hotel had other activities that we enjoyed, walks on a trek was fantastic, our guide was local and knew how people lived with nature.  We had an amazing", " experience with local villages who invited us to their home, allowed us to interact with their cow and her calf.  We used the table tennis and pool table, the temperature controlled pool and other amenities.  My personal highlights were the sun rise through the mountains and the tracks we took.  My only suggestion is for the resort to invest more into their travel desk.  Road is the only option to travel to this resort, but in reality there are flights and Heli Taxi services from Shimla airport that can be great options for guests who want to save the 6 hour road trip one way.  Thanks", "It’s a best hotel with extremely good location and views.  Brownie points- soft spoken staff, courteous services, food and spreads, location and views, activity room, heated pool and jacuzzi, live music, gazebos, temperature controlled rooms with fans for claustrophobic people like me, comfort, room size, hygiene, cleanliness, quality everything was more than perfect. Highly recommended this hotel. I booked it via TravelHouse which was an added benefit as they arranged everything before we reached. A must stay hotel.

The hotel is well built with good amenities but the rooms are tiny . The worst part is the service and hospitality of this property . One expects a certain level from a Taj property but the staff here lacks basic courtesy and manners . Although Mr krish and Miss kunjan tried there level best but a property cannot be managed by 2 people . The F and B staff is not only un trained but is also ill mannered . There service level is worst . The housekeeping staff is probably running on low budget as they have 5-6 ppl who are suppose to make your rooms in the property of 60 odd rooms . So you have to coax chase", " and request mutiple times for room cleaning which is completed by 6 pm . The spa is the only silver lining and it provides awesome treatments .

Drivers were good and so was the car.   Check-in was a huge wait and not fun after a long drive to the hotel. We asked for a room with a particular view, but completely disappointed with the room provided.   In Room Service: BAD... They take ages to get your food and by the time it gets to your room, it cold. We understand that it's 2'C outside, but there is no excuse for you to not bring our food in warmers... That's exactly why they are for. You choosing not to use it, just goes to show you don't care.

The package included a personalised photo frame, guess what, they didn't even bother asking me for a photo, how the hell are they gonna personalise it.. went to the reception and shared a photo, after all, i care, it's my wife's birthday.  Breakfast: Oh my god, a good spread no doubt, but nothing tastes good, tasted so hospital food like.   Pooja Kashyap was a blessing. If not for her, life would have been hell. Not that they care.  Will i come back..  maybe never ", "We were travelling from Manali to Shimla and reached the hotel late at 11 at night we were not asked to do the room formalities as we were travelling with a baby and also everyone was tired we were taken to our room straight away without any delay. The next day we took a look at the property which was absolutely beautiful the indoor pool was temperature controlled and the cleanliness was top class. The staff was very friendly.As I mentioned I was travelling with my 6 year old daughter her eating requirements were different from us and the staff and the chefs were able to arrange everything possible for her. We also experienced the Theog junction lounge bar the environment inside was exceptional the drinks were different from the usual ones and had a new concept to them. The view", " from the room was also very nice we could see tall mountains with snowy cliffs from our room balcony. They staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We look forward to visit again. Had a brilliant experience", "The hotel is far away from hustle bustle of Shimla and is surrounded with 360 degree mountain view. We visited in middle of march. Hence there was no snow but the weather was apt to experience different aspects of mountain life with the air so pure. There are plenty of Trail options. We ended up going to Narkanda which takes about an hour from the hotel. We recommend to go with an experienced driver. We were glad we chose car from the hotel and our driver Mr. Lucky was well versed and drove with utmost care on a road where either one could go or come. We were lucky to do snow activities like sledge and snow boarding.   Our supervisor Mr Syed Anwar took really good care from the time we booked the reservation. First with advance check-in hence we were handed keys the moment we", " arrived the hotel  and took care at every small detail possible till the check out. Special thanks to him and every other staff member who do their best to make your stay memorable. The staff at kids activity was also really amazing and she would take care of every child with love and patience. Couldn't be more thankful. The food options on menu could be limited but the chef would do their best to satisfy your need. We thank you once again for making our visit memorable. Hope we can come back again may be in the snow season.   Just to add a flavour - the swimming pool was indoor and temperature control which could be a big plus in the snow season and otherwise.   Thanks to Mr. Syed Anwar, our driver Mr. Ajay and every individual who took care with  love & great hospitality to make sure you have a wonderful memory back home.", "The property is 2 and half hours further up from Shimla, it’s snows here in December. That’s Excellant location. It’s a quiet place. Snow clad mountains can be seen all year round from the rooms. Hotel has amazing hot pool and high pressure hot jacuzzi. The spa with team of Florence takes very good care. The hotel arranges picnic at a nearby location, which is between the jungle. Mr. Anil took us there and was very good in his job. The chefs Mr. Patel and Mr. Shashant took personal care in arranging gluten free food. Staff including Ms. Anshita and Ms. Pratibha at front desk, Vishal for room service, Balveer and Gaurav at restaurant and Mr. Krish the manager ( he justifies his name by being super active) were always helping with a smile.", "We went to Taj Theog with high expectations and I must say that all of them were met and some more.   We had a most amazing experience right from the check in to check out.  The front office team headed by Mr. Jithesh JJ and his team comprising of Mohit, Syed, Pratibha, Priyanka,Tarun and Amshita left no stone unturned to give us one of the best experiences we have had. All Taj properties have great housekeeping staff but the housekeeping here was a notch up. Right from a heater to a steam inhaler to memory foam pillows everything was provided promptly. The housekeeping staff just needed to be told of the preferences once and then throughout the stay, one never had to repeat it. The property was full but there was no laxity in any of the services. A special thanks to Mr. Budhi", " Sharma and his team members Arun, Santosh, Mukesh, Lalit, Nitish, Simran and Ajay.   The F&B team of Mr, Bhandari, Deepak, Shagun, Ashok, Amitabh, Raman and Neeraj made every meal a celebration by getting local delicacies and stories behind each dish. The hot toddy made at the bar was the best that I have ever had and so was the local Rajma. I don't think that there was any meal that wasn't exceptionally good.  The massages at the Jiva spa were just sublime and the pool experience was wonderful too.  Taj Theog is one place where we would definitely like to come again and again.

The driver was attentive and polite, and obliged very willingly when we asked him to make several stops so we could stretch our legs, use the bathroom, or get a bite to eat (it’s a long drive to the hotel)  •\tWhen we arrived at the property, we were greeted by several staff members waiting outside, and when inside, we were gifted local Himachali hats     •\tGifts for me and my son, a cake, sweets and flowers were sent to our room over the four days we were there  •\tAn artistic souvenir was placed in the room on the fourth day of our stay, as a memento for us to take back with us  •\tA complimentary canister of oxygen was sent to my room when I mentioned my mild altitude sickness, and I was promptly connected to a doctor via phone for a quick consultation •\tOne member of staff was assigned to accompany my five-year-old son whenever he wanted to use the kids’ room, play table tennis or watch a movie in the AV room •\tOn two separate occasions, the staff asked whether they could get our jackets from our room, when it started to get chilly on the terrace in the evening  •\tThe staff were always around, and were superbly attentive – this is probably not everyone’s cup of tea, and it isn’t mine either, but I appreciated it on this occasion because I needed assistance with my son from time to time  •\tIf we were spotted sitting in the lobby after a meal, we were asked if we’d like tea, coffee or hot chocolate  •\tYogita, the activities manager (not sure if that’s her official designation), went out of her way to keep my son entertained every day, and was incredibly warm and obliging  •\tRajat, the tour guide who accompanied us through the coniferous forest flanking the hotel, on a wild strawberry hunt, seemed to know every nuance of the forest and put both the nature and local history into context for us. As we walked the trail, he picked up every tiny piece of plastic or paper he could spot (there weren’t many, but he got every one he saw). He was also hauling enough water in his backpack for all eight tour participants!  •\tWe never once felt hurried or rushed at the breakfast buffet, even though we arrived close to the end of breakfast on two occasions. In fact, the staff insisted that we order whatever we wanted at the table, even past 10:30am, which is when breakfast at the hotel ends.   •\tEvery staff member seemed to have first-hand knowledge of the local history, sights and cuisine – and happily made recommendations   •\tOne night, I wanted to sample the local ‘paan’ digestive, a betel-leaf preparation popular all over India. The front desk staff began calling all their drivers to figure who was in the city to be able to pick up a few pieces for me – and they arrived within two hours. It was too late for me to eat it then because I had turned in early, but they refrigerated it and served it to me after lunch the next day. All of this was complimentary!    There are other moments, too numerous to mention, but I think you get the idea.   The GM, Gaurav Issar, was very forthcoming with practical advice on how to make the most of our stay, and it’s clearly evident that the staff’s warmth, authenticity and attention to detail are inspired by his example. By the time we left, the Wildflower Hall team came as close to being real friends as a group of strangers could ever be.", "I was there with my husband and 2 kids for a 3N stay. It was a very refreshing short and apt holiday for all of us. While the drive from Chandigarh is tough, however it is all worth it when you reach the destination. Wildflower hall is one amazing property on the hills. And as always the service at the Oberois is par excellence. One feels so welcomed and the staff exuberates so much warmth in every interaction. This is evidenced right from the staff at the top to the bottom.   There are so many activities for kids and adults. We made sure to participate in each one of them. The yoga was refreshing by the yoga tutor.Housie as always is fun when played in a large group. The kids had a great time in the mixology activity where they learn to make different types of mocktails in the", " cavalry bar and the best of all was the nature trail at the wild strawberry trail. The staff member Rajat made it so interesting by sharing various stories of the hills, his own village, the flora and fauna of the hills and his experience of being on the hills. Various points seen during the trail were mesmerizing.   Housekeeping is excellent at the property.  The rooms are serviced twice and our floor incharge Nitin along with his team member Ankita made sure we never had any complaints. I had lost my fitbit there and they made sure they searched the room well enough to find it for me.  Food was excellent and Abhishek who was serving us made sure we tried their best dishes. Lasooni palak is to die for. He also asked the chef to add paneer in it and it was absolutely delicious. The Thai green curry is something one should definitely try. Kids enjoyed their kiddie pizzas and pasta.  Overall this was one amazing holiday and something I will definitely again go for and recommend to all.", "Oberoi Wildflower Hall is Colonial style property with Classic Decor. We were upgraded to mountain view Room. Please note that  all Rooms are spacious ( appx 450 Sq ft) , None of rooms has balconies. Breakfast & meals are excellent .Most significant was level of service -top notch & I feel Oberoi staff is highly motivated to serve Hotel guests. Right from Front desk , Conceirge, Restaurant , House keeping service level was unbeatable. Special mention of Bhavna, Pawan , Ujjwal, Sachit, Vishal , Prashant , Anmol & others - all were very helpful & courteous. This resort located at mountain top & is surrounded by forest reserve. We took self guided walking trails & it was great - enjoying walk in forest on mountain top. Enjoyed breakfast in morning on terrace with panoramic views", " over valleys & mountains.

Driver was very courteous. Highly recommended  Hotel to stay .", "This hotel embodies every fantasy you ever had. From the moment you walk through the doors to when you leave...you will experience luxury and a level of service unsurpassed anywhere. The setting is fantastic!  Tasteful opulence is everywhere. The views extraordinary. Set at the foothills of the Himalayas, you will see the snow peaks of the Himalayas in the distance. The various parts of the hotel: The card room, gym, spa and two poos (indoor and outdoor) are all lovely. The indoor and outdoor dining room and also dining in the gazebo outdoors and up a small hill...are experiences not to be missed.   Lalita took us on a tour upon arrival and then did our check in in our beautiful, spacious room. She was gracious and lovely. Sunit, the general manager also greeted us on arrival.  ", " Rajrishi, the Food and Beverage manager, was outstanding. His attention to detail was amazing and he was always there to guide everyone and everything and make sure everything was perfect. Amalendu Kumar was also excellent and MOST helpful at all times. Shreshtha was a lovely maitre d' in the dining room.   The Executive chef, Rajat Mukherjee, did a number of wonderful things that will stand out forever in our memories. He is also a most interesting person and we are most impressed to learn about all the recycling done by Oberoi properties and indeed in India in general. The food was wonderful, under his tutelage/guidance and skill.   Yash was also most helpful in the dining room. Manoj and Kingshuk our waiters, along with many other wait staff, were terrific.   Housekeeping was excellent and especially our Aayush. Nunu in the spa gave me a fabulous facial, designed to make me look younger. I am not sure that is possible, but it sure was wonderful!  Sanchit Bhatia, front office manager, was most interesting and very helpful.   Thank you to the whole team for this delightful stay. We will be back.  ", "I and my wife were at the property from 17th to 20th Sep. It is a lovely property and managed by a great team. I have stayed with other Oberoi properties as well, but what we experienced at Wildflower was outstanding. Special mention of Abhishek (F&B) and Yogita (took guests on nature trails). He was able to add an amazing touch whenever he was there. Your chefs also do a great job and the food was always very good. The breakfast was always a highlight and we virtually got whatever we wanted! Yogita also is an amazing person. She added a personal touch to the walks and comes across as a warm person. We had offered her a tip but she graciously refused and suggested any tips be made to the pool only. That speaks high of her value system. We also enjoyed the Yog session, although", " our body wasn’t perhaps prepared for the rigour! Dinners were amazing as well, and I don’t unfortunately recall the name of the team members. We had two dinners at the property and both the times the team was very attentive, caring and also added some extras. On day 1 they added a dessert (it was my birthday) and on day 2, they added an extra dal and rice. It is not really about the money, but about the warmth and making one feel special. Which we truly felt. The location of the property is amazing. Rooms are very well appointed and clean. Staff is available at a short notice to take care of any requests.  Some suggestions: 1. Lift cannot take 13 people so you may want to change that label claim! 2. I saw the team struggle to get all the cutlery etc away when it suddenly rained. I assume they would again put in the effort when the weather clears up. Maybe you could just provide them with waterproof covers to help them avoid all that effort! 3. Pls see if you can do away with plastic bottles completely and replace them with sealed reusable glass bottles. Some Taj properties have begun this practice. Or atleast offer the guests an option. We had chosen to use only water jugs in the room. 4. Pls put some signages on the road leading to the property beginning 4-5 kms before the property. We almost missed the ramp leading to the hotel and just caught it in the nick of time. The entrance can be better marked else it is easy to miss it and keep driving on the road. Google maps doesn’t show the accurate location.", "My husband and I celebrated our 40th Wedding Anniversary at This resort arriving after a 5 hour train journey from Kalka on the Toy train.

It far exceeded my expectations.", "Located at a height of 8250 feet up in the Himalayas with a spectacular view, the best property to stay with while coming up to Kufri from Shimla nearby to all the excursions.. The check-in process is smooth and  fast with clean & spacious rooms. The hotel offers complimentary everyday activities to do for all the age groups. Breakfasts are sunkissed and welcomed with outdoor and indoor seating areas giving a prefect sunrise and valley views. The restaurant and the hospitality team is prompt and always available on toes to make you feel homely and will not leave any stone unturned to make your stay a comfortable one. The property is well maintained offering great photographic points and backdrops. Also it offers a temperature controlled swimming pool, spa, billiards room, board", " games etc. and a exquisite shopping store(Tijori). The food served is great in taste and served with love as per your taste buds. Celebrated my special occasion there and as a kind gesture they had decorated my room at the time of check-in and had offered other best offerings. All standards at par. Not to forget to mention Ms. Tashi at the front desk, Mr. Kunal who had managed to arrange back my lost belongings at their Shimla property (The Cecil), Mr. Suman, Mr. Ayush at the restaurant, Mr. Arush, Mr. Nitin from the House keeping and the entire team who made all the efforts to make our stay a comfortable and a memorable one. Will be visiting again soon. A top recommendation to my friends and family. :)", "The understated elegance of the hotel totally blew us away. The hospitality of the staff and the welcome they gave us on our 30th anniversary made us feel rather special. Our room was decorated with rose petals and the lovely chocolate cake definitely left a sweet taste.  The hotel is beautiful. But it is warmth of the people there that makes it exceptional. A big thank you to Gaurav Issar and his team.   The spa treatment by Rini was priceless...felt I was floating. The food by Chef Satbir, specially the Kullu fish, was melt in your mouth tasty  We feel totally rejuvenated after this holiday. Whenever we think of Wildflower Hall, it puts a smile on our face. Already looking forward to our next trip there.  Atul and Jyoti Sahni", "We visited last week and stayed at the property for four nights.  Our trip to  Wildflower Hall was splendid, to say the least.  The staff took really good care of us and would constantly surprise us with little gifts every now and then.  A small platter of sweets every evening was an extremely thoughtful touch.  If I had to list the Pro's and Con's, they'd be as follows.  Pro's A wonderful team of people taking care of you as soon as you enter the property. A very scenic location, surrounded by countless pine trees. Rooms are extremely clean and well maintained. Most major 5 star chains today are lacking maintenance, this was so not the case here. Smart TVs! A rare hotel where you can watch Netflix in peace, if so desired. A stunning sunrise every morning from the deck. Please", " see the attached photograph. An excellent breakfast ordering menu, the buffet is a tad small though. Mind you, there is no curfew, you can walk in at 11 (or 12 noon for that matter) and still have breakfast. A plethora of activities to keep you entertained throughout your stay. Do look at the blackboard opposite the lifts.  Cons:- None, really. If I have to nitpick, then I'd say the room furnishings are very 2000s and even though they are not dated (simply because of the high level of maintenance), the furniture will eventually need renewal.  Secondly, the fancy TOTO Washlet/Bidet does take a little getting used to as most of us here in India prefer our health faucets.  Well, it helps that there was  at least a retractable Japanese made bidet, unlike most American hotel chains (I am looking at you IHG) that completely lack this option and leave you at the mercy of toilet paper.  In conclusion, I would like to quote Ferris Bueller when he speaks of a vintage Ferrari in the eponymous movie released in 1986...  \"It is so choice. If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up.\"  Yes, this hotel is so choice, that if you have the means, I'd highly recommend staying a night, at the very least.  There are so many wonderful people I came across during my stay and I remember only a few names. So, this time around, I'd like to compliment the entire staff, front and back, for making my stay so memorable.  I hope to stay at this property again, surely when it's snowing."], "rating": "5.0"},

Been developed by razing almost one entire hill to the ground ☹️ What I liked was that each room had hand sanitizer and mask. Their staff had also taken all COVID precautions.  The food was beyond awesome. Every single meal ! I wouldn't go here alone though. The property is so huge, it almost seems deserted. Didn't spot too many guards either. Also, the view from the rooms is great but if there is a pool side party with DJ wale babu playing music, then you can bid goodbye to your peace sleep and quietude.

Overall, it was an amazing day out.", "Visiting Dimapur, then its Niathu Resort. Always felt like home whenever I have stayed here. The staff are amazing and take care of you really well. Superb Property & Amazing Staff who know the true meaning of warm hospitality.  I have had an overall great experience at the property, be it the Front Desk, Housekeeping, Pool Bar, Restaurant or Room Service. Yet to try the pool and spa but I am sure they would not disappoint either. Keep it up."], "rating": "4.0"},
{"place": "The Serai Bandipur", "reviews": ["  I stayed @ The Serai Bandipur a few days ago. The week prior to our stay, my son tried to book 2 units by using his US credit card but it did not work. I had to use my Indian credit card & he had to transfer the funds to my SB account. Complicated & unnecessary procedures. Pls look into the matter for easy payments from non resident cards.  I find the food & bar charges are over priced. The resort was fully occupied @ many others were also mentioning it. Can you pls reduce your restaurant prices ? Pls make the lunches a buffet inclusive of the booking price as the breakfasts & only the dinner as A La Carte. It will then be a fair deal. At this point my America based dil said it is a rip off as there are not many activities on offer.  Pls give concessions in stay food & drink &", " safaris, to senior citizens as my husband & myself. I am shocked you do not offer concessions to elders. This is my third stay @ Serai Bandipur & there are no enhancements from the time of starting the resort. The road to the resort has deteriorated so much our spines will collapse dentures will fall out & eye lens get dislocated. Pls get the approach lanes resurfaced through the government. It doesnt have to be in this shocking state.  Jayashree Prasad", "Serai Bandipur is an absolutely beautiful resort with gorgeous hill views from some of the rooms and from the restaurant and bar. People are nice and friendly and food is above average. The only reason why I have rated it 4 (and not 5) is because of the tough time we had there with their internal communication system. We were there for 3 nights and it rained in the evening all three days. They switch off their Intercom in case of rain and with mobile network zero or poor there you are stuck inside the room. With two young kids and having waited for half an hour, I decided to take an umbrella to go to their restaurant to request for some food. They promptly made the food and sent it to the room and the restaurant mgr gave me his mobile number and asked me to call him I need", " anything else. The next evening it was the exact same situation and luckily I was getting some mobile network. I tried calling the restaurant manager and guess what - he had not recharged his phone and incoming calls were barred. I called the reception mobile number and asked them to pass on the food order to the restaurant. They said they will ask the restaurant to call us. That call never came. Imagine sitting hungry in a cold rainy night and waiting for food. We were cognizant of the fact that we were in a remote place but feeding ourselves and our kids on time cannot be counted as an unrealistic expectation.  Tip - Carry a Jio SIM with you if you are going there, Airtel barely gets network there and the resort wifi is really patchy.", "We had a 2 night stay and it was an outstanding experience from the welcome to the checkout. The huge property is wonderfully maintained and the location is very unique as it blends into the forest area. We saw lots of deer, peacocks and various species of birds around the property . The room decor is themed perfectly to the forest theme with lots of natural elements in the design.  The staff is extremely courteous and took really good care of all the minute asks from us. Special call out to Mr Vivek the naturalist who does the guided nature walks and the excellent knowledge he shared with us. The Sanctuary restaurant had ample choices and high quality food.   Overall a must see for any nature lovers bucket list.", "booked a residence through their website,was attended by ms.shreelakshmi,who responded promptly and clearly..got all the details.the resort started as cicadia resorts in 2007-08,then took over by cafe coffee day in 2012.The resort has a total of 24 rooms,in 18 acres of land.The thing standing out from other resorts is the location,its far from everything,the nearest village mangala is about 5 kms away,which is part of the experience!!  The staff were really outstanding,Mr.nixon and Mr.guruprasad from the front desk were really helpful,,they contacted me thru whats app,told me the best routes to the resort,helped me with everything they could..no calls or queries to the front desk were left unattended,be it day or night,they really deserve 7 stars..Mr.imran the naturalist,is the", " most knowledgable you can find.we have breakfast buffet,others a la carte..the menu is limited,but the nearest restaurant is 17 kms away..the food was very tasty,and the quantity was high,2 of us,could simply share one dish..Mr.baswanthan from the restaurant was really helpful,even delivered a chocolate cake to our room,for my wifes birthday,promptly at 12..very tasty and fresh.(hard to find that kind of hospitality,in the middle of a forest)..a big thanks to the chef and everyone to make it possible.. lots of activities,the safari is in tie up with jungle resorts and lodges,was truly remarkable..great comfortable spa,with good amenities..truly relaxing the resort has 2 residences,we stayed in no.2,it was huge and roomy,there was normal wear and tear in the furniture,other than that nothing to complain..one thing was the airconditioner wasnt exactly quiet,you pay 30k/night..you cant have a split ac,with blower sound..the water pressure in the overhead shower was less..but these things could simply be ignored,once you lay down,on the day bed in the terrace,in the mild breeze at night...simply awesome...worth every paisa you pay..cant wait to visit again..thank you for making our stay memorable..", "Wow! What a happy and a peaceful stay! It was only a mom and 16year old son's stay for 2 days during mid August. \"Safe/secured with wonderful staff all around\" and \"Every angle/view was filled with green 'n flowers, add-on bird chirping\".  These are the things missing elsewhere nowadays.     Very well maintained and clean!  We stayed in superior courtyard. Work space and forest facing balcony are its highlights.  Spacious rooms and modern/clean bathrooms. Too good! Vegetarian food was good. They prepared spicy and delicious food, according to our taste.   Special thanks to all staff at : Reception/admin, restuarant(very helpful), cleaning staff, security, buggy guy, jeep driver who organized safari and provided us a jeep. We could sight tiger 3 times, along with other animals,", " which was unforgettable! Beauty and beast : is justified! Nature walk was driven by a very knowledgable guy who gave us so nice info and made us part of nature! Thanks.", "The Serai holds a very special place in my and my family's heart as it is literally the only chain of resorts that we trust, and frequent. Having been to their Chikmaglur property in 2012 and then Kabini in 2017, it only made sense to visit their third, and final in-country resort in 2021.  After a failed attempt to visit Bandipur in March 2020 (thank you, Covid), we decided to take a risk and try once more in December 2021. Having made the bookings as early as October, we were so excited about the trip. Only to hear that a new wave of the coronavirus was starting again and we genuinely feared that our trip would be cancelled. Fortunately the gods had mercy on us, and we could proceed on our holiday.  Coming to Bandipur, it is truly a magical place, literally far from the", " maddening urban concrete jungle. There's a jungle here alright, but the kind you wish you could move in to!   The Serai Bandipur is well maintained with some of the most hospitable and caring staff I have come across. While I am ashamed to not remember all their names, Nixon, Imran we courteous, gracious and just down right charming.  A special mention to one of the waiters - Ravi. Hard working man who has spent close to 9 years here. I wish him personally all the best.  The resort is expanse and there is a lot to do. We stayed in the Mountain View Courtyard, which is comfortable for a family of 2, or if you have a small one under the age of 6.  I do have one grouse. The breakfast was the only meal that was covered under the package while we had to pay for lunch and dinner. The meals, while tasty and lovely, is a tad bit expensive, especially when you factor in 2 meals, 3 guests for 3N. I hope this is a temporary arrangement and that all meals will be covered in the package going forward.  I still won't take away a star from my rating as it is Serai and we really enjoyed our time there, after what I can truly say were the worst two years of our lives. Thank you Serai, for making us forget about all that, temporarily.", "The Serai Bandipur is a must visit! Right from our arrival (before checkin) till checkout has been great. Guruprasad had been in touch with me asking for our check in formality documents, food preferences and arrival time a day before itself. I wasn’t available over the phone, so he left me what’s app messages for the same. Very prompt and efficient. We were greeted by Nixon on arrival alone with a drum roll entrance welcome. While he briefed us with the hotel, we were served warn lemon ginger tea. Nixon then gave us a tour of the property, absolutely beautiful! We stayed for 3 nights in the Mountain Log Hut room which has been a beautiful experience. Lovely room size, outdoor and indoor sitting area, extremely beautiful bathroom, two wash basins, separate shower and wc", " cubicles. Room was equipped with all basic amenities along with bars and juice in the minibar, cookies, chocolates, tea coffee, plum cake and wine. The housekeeping staff has been extremely prompt and helpful.  The restraint serves buffet breakfast and a la carte lunch and dinner, also serves a special food menu from 3pm to 7pm. The food is excellent, fresh and made as per your taste. Rakesh at the restaurant has been very kind and helpful. We took 3 safaris in Bandipur national park. 2 morning safaris by private gypsy and 1 canter safari by the hotel. All 3 were excellent experience, a must do. The hotel is equipped with game room, spa and gym, swimming pool also. They bonfire is fun to sit at during evenings. We later took the evening forest trail nature walk, with Imran. Imran is excellent and full of knowledge about the forest, animals and plants. A must do!  Our overall experience at The Serai Bandipur has been excellent and very happy to share such lovely review for the hotel. Three Cheers to each and every staff member of the hotel.", "We had beautiful 2 days to spend at the Serai resort. The staff is very helpful and do all they can go you to have a pleasant stay. I would suggest book the log Hut. It's beautiful, earthy and the bathrooms are so pretty. Property is very safe and well equipped. They have a nice pool, no bath tubs. Food from local cuisine is exquisite and i loved the Nilgiri mutton gravy. Don't try the wings, they call them hot but it's barbeque sauce. The breakfast was my absolute favourite, i loved their scrambled eggs and the lovely staff they have all around the property. The spa services were also great, I had a really skilled masseuse. They have a pit where they light a fire, we sat there after others left but the staff never asked us to leave they just let you have a good time, ofcourse", " we respected their property rules. Privacy is the most cherished present they offered for our stay along with always smiling faces. Overall a great experience.   Among things to do they offer a nature walk, 2 times a day. And organise the safari at Bandipur National Park, i recommend earlier booking for the jeep because the bus is extremely noisy and the only last minute option.   If you get bored and have a car, there's a place nearby where the river Maya bifurcates, its supposed to be beautiful.", "What a serene location. The last 2 to 3 kms , leading to the property itself is full of valley views and is a sign of things to come. The moment you enter the resort,  it calms you like a warm loving hug from nature.  So serene and quiet with just the sounds of birds and nothing else.   The property is undoubtedly luxurious. Beautiful spacious rooms with lovely balcony overlooking gardens/ mountain   Service was impeccable and you could feel the staff  genuinely cares to ensure guests are well taken care of.   The property is vast and my son had a great time exploring the nature walks and cycling   Due to COVID the restaurant was only serving a la carte and food though expensive had huge portions so justified Their restaurant too had Beautiful mountain views.   The SPA", " experience was good and they have well trained therapist.   Undoubtedly the best in Bandipur. Would love to return and recommend this place", "On the last leg of our long awaited trip, we decided to stay at Serai Bandipur. Buoyed by the service at Serai Kabini, our last trip before Covid-19 struck, we  really looked forward to it. We got approx. 10 calls from the manager to confirm our 'exact' time of arrival and our current location. Negotiating the hill ways with a 3 year old's motion sickness was hard enough. Even though I told them our position, they kept on calling. The icing on the cake was that when we reached the resort, there was no one from the front desk or management to welcome us! We had to wait at the reception while the lone hotel staff present called numbers to check details of our stay. After repeatedly asking them to let us in to at-least one room because my daughter was covered in vomit, the staff", " finally took us to our rooms. All would have been okay if the manager had come and spoken to us. That was wishful thinking. The saving grace was the housekeeping and the restaurant staff who were nice and made us feel comfortable. Food was really good. House cleaning was impeccable. On the last day of our trip, we had a morning safari, because of which we were to be back by 11 AM (their checkout time), about which we had informed the front desk. While at the safari office, we get a message that we need to leave the rooms sharp at 11. We sent a message that we would leave one of the rooms at 11 and the next by 12 since we would need some time to have breakfast and freshen up before we head back. On reaching the resort, we were reminded of this again by the front desk and we nodded.  We promptly moved our things to one room and informed them that the room is empty. I did not understand the urgency to make us leave the room as they did not even clean the room we vacated. We left the resort after paying our bills at 12:20 PM. I was hoping to end the trip on a high, but that was not meant to be. I guess Serai will be off my list going forward."], "rating": "4.5"},
{"place": "Padmini Resort", "reviews": ["Away from town , in a quiet area, its a decent place with good rooms. But it falls short of a resort - the pool was closed when I was there and there is little else. While there are tea gardens nearby, it isn't in the middle of one. It seems to be a popular place for weddings and receptions and I had one in each of the three days I was there. There went the chance of a quiet time.  If you have your own transport, as I had, then fine. Else you are stuck inside. It is also a tad expensive. The staff try their best to help and service is good though.", "The place is good for stay away from city. Almost all the amenities provided. Cool and calm place to relax. The rooms of the Hotel are also in good condition and overall very good service provided by the Hotel staff.", "We stayed here for three nights and it was a lovely experience. Unfortunately it was during the pujas so the menu was limited but all in all we had a very satisfying experience. The rooms (we had a cottage and another one on the first floor) were clean and good, the staff very cordial and friendly, and the grounds  are nice and well maintained. Don't forget to feed the fish, its lovely to see all those pretty fish swarming for food!", "Its an awesome place to spend a night.A very natural amid tea garden and with refreshing aroma ,it will always pull you to visit again. Situated just 2 Km away from Dibru Shaikowa National park ,further adds to the exotica of this hotel.Food qualities are very good and reasonably priced. A pond with colorful fish and beautiful Swimming pool further ameliorates the beauty of this resort and a well maintained reasonably priced bar is last in its features. One area which needs improvement ,is behaviour of the receptionist guy,he is very stringent and too much into regulations. Besides Complimentary breakfast is limited in quantity ,You can have either poor-Bhaji or bread omlettee. Thats hilarious ,the young guy who sits on receptionist is too harsh ,accomodation for driver is not", "Beautiful  & comfortable resort, excellent housekeeping, tasty food, cordial staff  what else you need for a perfect holidays.

This must be the best place in Tinsukia to stay. Room Service is excellent and very prompt.", "I recommend this resort to everyone visiting Dibru Saikhowa National Park. The resort with its magnificent ambience, the warm and efficient staff and the super clean and comfortable cottages/rooms will make you want to come back to this place again and again. I went there with my family and friends during the end of December. While the kids played and explored all the interesting things of the resort, we had a lovely time. The sumptuous lunch on the 31st December and the DJ night was of superlative quality. The stay at this fantastic resort will remain as one of my most memorable experiences.", "Just a few minutes away from the exotic Dibru Saikhuwa national park, this resort is the perfect place to rest . The staff is very helpful, accommodating and prompt.Neat and clean well decorated comfortable rooms with a/c and room heaters.  Good thing is that there is a very nice area for kids to play with and also a pool and a fish pond. The house keeping staff cleaned the floor thrice in a day on request, when we walked into the room with soiled shoes from the Dibru Saikhuwa grasslands :) An absolutely amazing place to stay for tourists and bird enthusiasts .", "I was just thinking what should be the title of this review, then it came to my mind - \"neat little resort\"... & that's absolutely what it is, a neat little resort with all the amenities required for a short break... This place has ample space for the kids to run around, with a little pond with fish & ducks, a typical country atmosphere. The rooms are very neat & food at their restaurant is great & inexpensive. They also have a swimming pool & party hall, conference hall, etc... But the best part that we enjoyed is there is a tea estate right opposite to the resort & we went for long walks by the tea bushes. The only issue we had was that it's a little distance away from Tinsukia town, so after a couple of nights, we shifted to hotel Aroma Residency which is far closer to the", "I came across Padmini in october  when i last visited home ! nestled in the midst of tea estates and an open space, it is the besets thing to have happened to the state. As the management of this place claim their guarantee of a first class service and amenities, please be ready to keep your expectations top notch as they will not disappoint you. The rooms and cottages are very well maintained. Their garden area, play area and swimming pool are all modern amenities available to a traveller. My favorite is the restaurant menu and quality of food,its a good value of money.
