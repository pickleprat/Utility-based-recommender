It is 1 km distance from main bus stand or Tukaram mandir. Local food can be tried here. Nice river view from temple.", "Dehu near Pune is primarily known for its association with Sant Tukaram, a towering figure in the annals of India's religious history. His legacy is particularly manifest in this part of India. There has arguably been no better practitioner of the Abhang form of devotional poetry. We made two visits to Dehu within a span of 9 months to visit the temples associated with Sant Tukaram. The first one was on a cool January day. The second one was three days back after monsoonal rains had lashed the land. Both journeys started from Pimple Saudagar. We hired a car the first time and drove ourselves the second time. ", "There are quite a few temples in Dehu bearing the tag of Tukaram. We visited the Tukaram Janmasthan Mandir, the home in which he grew up and the Tukaram Gatha Mandir (memorial). All of them are set on the banks of the Indrayani River which flows through Dehu. Post-monsoon, the river made for a good sight, full and flowing. On an off-day, it should be easy to find a spot on the banks of the river and spend a fulfilling hour or so.", "The Gatha Mandir was fairly crowded the first time around (a Saturday) and had barely anyone the second time (a Sunday two days after Ganesh Chaturthi). There are numerous shrines within the temple to Ganesha, Vittala, Shiva and others in the pantheon. The first visit included an absorbing scene that typified the influence the Sant continues to wield in these parts. There were about 70-100 women of varying ages seated underneath a shamiana erected in an open space adjacent to the sanctum sanctorum. They were hunched over books that compiled the Sant's Abhangs. Duly aided thus, they sang them aloud in rhythmic bursts that reverberated through the temple. A fitting sight. The second visit was bland in comparison. ", "The home in which he grew up is but 50 odd paces from the main entrance of the Tukaram Janmasthan Mandir and is worth a quick visit. The home, which must have been larger in its heyday, is now pared down by surrounding encroachments to a single hall with a mezzanine floor doubling up as a patchy looking balcony. ", "Tukaram Gatha Mandir is a different proposition altogether. It is a new-age memorial constructed recently to pay tribute to the eponymous personage. Space is no constraint here and the memorial feels rather roomy. The unique thing, as anyone who has been here will attest to, is the elegant inscribing of nearly 4000-odd Abhangs on the internal walls of the memorial. For the Marathi-literate, this place merits an hour or two of immersion. For Tukaram devotees and/or Abhang aficionados, it is a veritable treasure trove. Being neither, I still found myself engaged in a fruitless search for \"Saavle Sundara Roopa Manohara\". In a flight of fancy, I did imagine a deep cavernous voice like Pt.

You need not hire a horse and simply follow people / horsemen going to the points. It is a simple jungle walk if you can do it.

Finally, we felt bad for the horsemen having little income and paid 2000 to 4 person (3 horsemen and one helper).

The experience was alright, the carrier had good seating arrangement in the lower deck and the passengers could climb upto upper deck if they so desired.  While returning from Mandwa jetty due to time constraints we took Ajanta ferry, which takes longer time to reach as compared to PNBC carrier.  The ferry was open unlike PNC carrier but it had its own advantages as you can absorb the sight in a much better way.  Overall it is quite enjoyable ride in both the carriers.

Tickets cost INR 100 for Indian citizens, and an additional INR 100 If you want to take pictures even if it's through a phone camera. The museum has a main gallery and an extension gallery, the latter holding the more interesting exhibits, in my view. It can get hot and sweaty in the afternoon because most of the museums did not have AC.

Mr Mamun is an excellent professional who knows every corner of his country and with him you will see the true Bangladesh", "Petros Triantafillidis from Greece", "I surfed through recommendations,then picked and called Mr Mamun to organise a weeklong tour out of Cox's Bazar. We never met but it was clear he knew his stuff - and he sure delivered!  A van took us up to the Chittagong Hill Tracts - the crucial passes having been organised in just a few days.  We were picked up  by the local guide in an open 4wd - great for seeing the views! While we waited at the first (of many) military checkpoints which our guide beautifully (if better than his English).  We were able to admire the scenery spent a night in a charming village eco guest house in Ruma, another at the excellent Hillside Resort in bandaburan. We visited the tourist sites, temple,toured a river, absorbed the scenery and regretted not scheduling a trek. We then transferred to a very good guide Mr Rasel for a night at a local hotel in Rangamati.  We explored its busy night markets and its extensive artificial lake on a boat by day learning how the locals continue to adapt to destruction of much of their agricultural life and land with the imposition of the power generating lake decades ago.  The hill tracts are definitely worth visiting, though permits restricting.  Village/ers, scenery, bhuddist temple, river side and lake tours etc all great, if military presence evidence of continuing issues for the local non bengalis.   We were then driven to Chittagong to an adequate central hotel whose owners son Mr Hridoy proved a brilliant first time guide including organising the requested boat trip beside one of the famous ship graveyards.  Overnight train after that to Sylhet was ok, so was Sylhet especially the river rock and silt hand \"mining\" at the border with Assam.  Hotel more than good enough.  We were then driven to the charming Hindu town Sreemangal with the excellent local guide Mr Tapas Dash, stayed and rested in a comfortable eco lodge, toured the markets, the tea plantations and national parks.  Top trip, local guides and drivers everywhere, lots of links in a chain pulled together in only a few days all worked.  Mr Mamun also threw in a car in Dhaka to pick us up from the Sreemangal train.

The 15-day tour started with a 4-day private boat tour in the Sudarbans. In this way we have had the whole sector of the boat intended for guests reserved for us and the possibility to modify the cruise itinerary in every moment. Mr. Mamun organized a program aimed at seeing the most interesting places and animals of this unique and very important place from the environmental point of view. The boat we used and especially the crew made this exploration very interesting and enjoyable: the professionalism and kindness of the crew were beyond any expectation and the food cooked was unexpectedly excellent and it also included evening BBQs with shrimps, crabs and fish caught by the fishermen encountered while sailing the channels. Mr. Mamun was our guide in the Sundarbans and with him we went also to visit the most interesting historical places in Bangladesh. During the 5-days of the historical part of the tour we visited several sites among the others: Bagerhat, Puthia Temple city , several Mosques in the area north of Chapai Nawabganj, Paharpur, Dinajpur, Panam City. It was a tour that embraced the history of the country in its forms of Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic and colonial cultures. Every visit has been made fantastic and unique by local people who, as the only European tourists, has continually sought a human contact, dialogue and selfie as a memory. In this already excellent condition, Mr. Mamun has shown a lot of flexibility and ability to optimize visits, overcoming the difficulties of traffic and any variant of situations, making the program complete and even adding some unplanned moments of relaxation. The visit continued in the Lawachara National Park where in 2 days of morning and evening walks in the forest, we were able to see the Western hoolock gibbon Hoolock hoolock, one rare and endangered primate.

The quality of roads in both directions/routes was quite good (>90%). To start with I took the route via Karkala &  Kudremukh to Sringeri. This is longer by about 15 kms. While the route is scenic, one must know that a significant portion of it is single lane and a substantial route through the Kudremukh Reserve Forest. There's minimal habitation and no restaurants once you enter the forest area. The road surface is not an issue & there are no hair pin bends. It took about 2 hrs 20 minutes to get to Sringeri.

On the return we drove back via Agumbe. This route has more habitate though one needs to negotiate 14 hair pin bends.

On the trail, there's a resting shed if you'd want to take a break. Theres a prayer area too so to be more respectful, it would be better to save the music for the summit.

The Tourism Department and local bodies have cleaned up the peak area tremendously and we did not find any plastic waste.

I suggest that you skip the adventure area near the parking lot and save some energy for the hike up to the peak as the adventure area and village site can be visited once you've come back.

We reached Panchtarini around 2:30 pm and then took the help of “palki” to reach the Holy cave of Baba Amarnath, situated at an altitude of 3888 m (12756 ft).  The palki is made by tying a folding chair tightly on two bamboo poles which is carried by four palki-bearers. The path from Panchtarni to the Holy cave is about 6 kilometers but it is very treacherous. And riding on the palki in that path is no less thrilling than riding on a roller coaster. Unlike roller coasters, on the palki no safety harness is used.  Holding on to the bamboo poles tightly and constant chanting “Om Namah Shivay” helped ease some of my fears and allowed me to enjoy the breathtakingly gorgeous views of the surrounding snow-capped mountains, valleys and the glacial rivers.  I was amazed at the palki bearers ability to carry us through this difficult terrain; they don’t even think about where they would put their next step; no matter where they step on, be it mud, snow, ice or boulder, they somehow manage to keep their balance and us safely seated in the palki. It is because of their hard work, people like me and my mother are able to have the darshan of Lord Amarnath.", "We reached the Holy cave around 5 pm and had an awesome darshan of the 3-feet ice Shiva Linga. The jawans from CRPF did an outstanding job of controlling the thousands of devotees who had come for the darshan. When our darshan was over, it was almost time for the Sandhya Aarti; so we decided to wait for some more time in the cave. Around 6 pm, the Sandhya Aarti started. The vibrations from the chants, the occasional dripping of the water from the melting of the ice from the roof of the cave, the beautiful view of the ice linga and having my mother next to me made it a surreal experience, the one that I will cherish forever.

It is manageable for a night.", "5. The Yatra is open only for a few weeks. If you are planning to go, please complete the Yatra within the first week or so.

A good area meant for park. No maintenance at all. There is an entry ticket ( I remember as Rs. 20 per head). We could feel a bit happy seeing the Big Bamboo bushes in which each bamboo trunk diameter is almost 9 inches and more. There are some good old trees. Most of the sections are closed. There is no one available from the organisation. Some models, idols made out of iron mesh etc are spoiled. Really very saddened part of such a bad maintenance.", "Also known as the Ipecac garden as this place was once used to cultivate ipecacuanha, a medicinal plant.

There is an exhibition / display inside it as well which showcases the region's beautiful products. Have been there several times for picnic lunches. You pack your own food, take some mats / bed-sheets, some sporting equipment and land at Saramsa for a nice leisurely day. A walking trail offers access to the river where you can splash around in the water but beware the string currents. You can also choose to eat at one of the many eateries just outside the gardens.

{"place": "Rayong Sunrise View Point", "review": ["About 9 km away from Ravangla, on the way to Namchi is Rayong Sunrise view point. It is on the Ravangla-Damthang Road. If you are visiting Namchi from Ravangla get down at the Rayong Busty; here a must visit is the pine forest, the trees are so tall that one would look puny underneath their shadow. As for the sunrise point, the place is not that well maintained. It’s all bushy and slippery. There are stairs, got hidden under the bushes, follow the trail and you would end up in front of a spooky resting place which is an unfinished monastery as it seemed. Had it been under maintenance it would have been indeed a notable place. The road from the busty to the point is a true delight to the camera lenses with the mountain peak and pine trees in the backdrop.", "For more do visit the reviewer website associated with the profile.
